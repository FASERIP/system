            Included below is a partial list of possible Contacts for characters operating in the Marvel Universe or in
            one of its close variants. Many of these Contacts are usable in any type of campaign, but here are noted for
            their role in the Marvel Universe.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each entry for a Contact delineates the type of aid that may be granted. either in information, skills,
            heroic help, and/or equipment. The more powerful a Contact, the more likely that Contact may interfere with
            the hero's life. requesting favors, providing missions, and the like. A low level Contact like a snitch in
            the criminal element provides fewer ties to the character than knowing the President on a first name basis
            ("Cap? Hi. This is Ronny. 1 have this problem in Central America...:').

                either for free or charge an affordable tee. The Contact may be a doctor at a local hospital or clinic,

                    Talent</a>, who will provide legal assistance for a reduced fee and legal advice to the hero for
                free. The Contact may be a lawyer whose firm has been an retainer with the family for years, is a
                personal friend, or who owes the hero for providing his big break into the profession.</dd>
            <dt id="law_enforcement">Law Enforcement</dt>
            <dd>The hero with this Contact has a friend, ally, or acquaintance with <a

                law-enforcement profession. This may include forces of local and state police and the national guard,
                and may vary in rank from knowing a patrolman (Excellent rank knowledge of the world at large.
                Remarkable of his beat), being on good terms with a Detective (Remarkable knowledge of criminal
                investigation. plus detective skills), or being well-known to a station captain or commissioner
                (Remarkable Resources, limited to that material which police forces normally have). Note that the higher
                the Contact. the more likely the Contact will get in touch with the hero when he needs help.</dd>
            <dt id="military">Military</dt>
            <dd>The character has a Contact in the armed forces, either of the United States or another nation. This may
                range from a low-level sergeant to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Military Contacts may provide Amazing
                Resources, maximum.</dd>
            <dt id="business_world">Business World</dt>
            <dd>The character has a Contact in the world of business or finance. This may rank from the accountant for
                their hero's group to a captain of industry who is trying to build fusion plants across the country.
                Resources available are at the Incredible level.</dd>
            <dt id="journalism">Journalism</dt>
            <dd>Journalist Contacts are Poor in Resources (unless you want to borrow the Mobile-Three Action-Camera van)
                but have Remarkable knowledge about their field of expertise. (If your Contact is a city desk reporter,
                she may be aware of something going down on the streets. If the Contact is in entertainment, maybe he
                has free passes to the ballet.)</dd>
            <dt id="crime">Crime</dt>
            <dd>The character with this Contact has some connection with the criminal underworld. This ranges from
                having a snitch that pass on information about street action, such as Turk Barrett is for Daredevil. up
                to a Contact high in the hierarchy of the Maggia or independent gangs. WARNING: Having criminal Contacts
                may place the hero in Karma-losing or Contact-losing situations, with the hero having to choose between
                losing a criminal Contact or losing Karma by aiding the Contact. High-level criminal Contacts
                (Remarkable Resources or higher) may seek to manipulate the hero to their own ends (the best example of
                which is the Kingpin of Crime).</dd>
            <dt id="engineering">Engineering</dt>
            <dd>The character with this Contact has some connection with someone who builds, either independently or for
                a larger corporation. The character may aid in the construction of devices.</dd>
            <dt id="psychiatry">Psychiatry</dt>
            <dd>The character with this Contact has some connection with a character in the fields of psychiatry or
                psycho-analysis, including doctors devoted to the curing of the criminal mind.</dd>
            <dt id="espionage">Espionage</dt>
            <dd>The character with this Contact has connections with the world of espionage. This includes agencies such
                as the FBI, CIA, NSA, KGB, Interpol, M15, S.H.I.E.L.D., and the criminal organization H.Y.D.R.A. Such
                Contacts provide information up to Remarkable level, though top-secret information will be harder to
                obtain. Equipment may be provided for up to Incredible rank. Amazing for S.H.I.E.L.D. and H.Y.D.R.A. All
                these agencies have no concern about using Contact heroes as agents to their own ends, and any hero that
                uses a Contact in this area will be guaranteed to receive a request for a return favor some time in the
                near future.</dd>
            <dt id="hero_group">Hero Group</dt>
            <dd>The character has some connection with, or was or is a member of or an ally of some existing group of
                superpowered heroes, and as such may enjoy the privileges thereof. This includes using their equipment.
                calling them in on an emergency, using their HQ, and benefiting from their training. As an example, the
                Mutant Dazzler, while not a member of the X-Men, maintains a good relationship with them and has
                benefited from training with them. The player running this hero may choose the group, subject to the
                approval of the Judge. Excessive liberties taken with the privileges (cracking up three Quinjets in a
                row) may result in the contract's revocation. The other disadvantage (in addition to being at the
                group's beck and call) is that enemies of the hero group are considered enemies of this hero as well. A
                hero who belongs to a group is always considered to have that group as a Contact lance an Avenger,
                always an Avenger).</dd>

            scientific ability. The Contact may have Resources varying from Good to Remarkable, determined by the Judge.
            The Contact has the Talent listed as in Appendix B, and a Reason of no less than Excellent. The scientific
            skills include: Chemistry, Biology. Geology, Genetics, Archeology, Physics. Computers, and Electronics.
            Acting and Performing, while not "scientific" skills, are Contacts that perform in a similar fashion (the
            character knows someone with that skill).</p>

            <dd>The hero has an ally in state government — connected with the office of governor, a state

                Resources of up to Monstrous in their field may be gained, but the more powerful the Contact, the more
                likely the favor will be called in.</dd>
            <dt id="other_national">Other National</dt>
            <dd>The hero has a Contact in national government — someone else's. The hero may be friendly with the
                leadership or government apparatus of any other nation, friend or foe. This Contact, if known to others,
                may create difficulties in dealing with other political Contacts. Resources available are as for
                National government, but the character must be able to communicate with the Contact to gain any
                materials.</dd>
            <dt id="international">International</dt>
            <dd>The hero has Contacts in the UN or in a similar multi-national organization, such as the Common Market

            <dt id="occult_lore">Occult Lore</dt>
            <dd>The hero knows someone who "dabbles" in the darker arts, and as such has at least a Remarkable Reason
                involving these matters. The Contact may provide advice on mystic writings, spells and their castings,
                and curses. The Contact is not necessarily someone of Doctor Strange's category (a true magic-wielder),
                but most likely a college professor who has done copious reading on the subject.</dd>
            <dt id="mythology">Mythology</dt>
            <dd>Similar to Occult Lore, with the direction towards recognized mythology: actions of the
                extra-dimensional beings known as gods (Olympians, Asgardians, etc.). The Contact will specialize in one
                "pantheon" of deities.</dd>
