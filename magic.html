            <dt id="magically_enhanced">Magically Enhanced</dt>
            <dd>A character whose abilities have been permanently affected by magic—a type of <a
                    href="/system/origins.html#altered_human">Altered Human</a>.</dd>
            <dt id="magical_item">Magical Item</dt>
            <dd>An item created by magic or any item that functions by magic.</dd>
            <dt id="magic-wielder">Magic-Wielder</dt>
            <dd>A character able to use spells. Such characters may also be called magicians, sorcerers, wizards,
                enchanters, etc.</dd>
            <dt id="spells">Spells</dt>
            <dd>The spells of a magical character are just like the powers of another hero, except that they are derived
                from magical sources. These are also called enchantments, incantations, etc.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h4 id="creatures">Creatures</h4>
        <dl>
            <dt id="pet">Pet</dt>
            <dd>Pet indicates a normal-looking animal that is completely obedient to the character. The animal has some
                magical link to the character, such as, it can magically communicate with the character, the hero can
                see through the animal’s eyes when he wishes, the hero can switch bodies with the pet when he wishes,
                and so on (Judge’s discretion). If the pet is ever destroyed, the player character may be able to find
                and train a new one (Judge’s discretion). The size and type of animal is completely up to the Judge and
                player.</dd>
            <dt id="mount">Mount</dt>
            <dd>Mount indicates a large animal such as a horse, giant bird, large cat, etc., that the hero can ride. The
                mount usually has at least one powerful magical ability or power of its own, such as, flying, phasing
                through solid objects, body armor, etc. (Judge’s discretion). Valkyrie’s winged horse, Aragorn, is an
                example of a magical mount.</dd>
            <dt id="familiar">Familiar</dt>
            <dd>Familiar indicates a being that is very powerful magically and actively assists the hero. Two powers
                should be rolled randomly or selected by the Judge from the personal and universal energy lists for this
                familiar. In addition, the familiar is intelligent (Reason and Psyche at least Typical) and can
                communicate with its owner (the kind of communication is left to the Judge’s discretion). The form of
                the familiar can either be that of a normal animal (usually a cat) or an unusual type, such as a small
                dragon or other mythical creature. The familiar’s form is at the player’s discretion.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h4>Magic Wielding Characters</h4>
        <p>
            This type of magical character derives his powers from spells using personal, universal, or dimensional
            energy (see the <a href="#magical_energies">MAGICAL ENERGIES</a> section for the details on these three
            types of energy). Not all magic wielders are alike.
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt id="personal_energy_only">Personal Energy Only</dt>
            <dd>Personal Energy Only means that the character can only have spells listed as Personal Energy. These
                spells can only be utilized by the character using his own, personal energy.</dd>
            <dt id="personal_and_universal_energies_only">Personal and Universal Energies Only</dt>
            <dd>Personal and Universal Energies Only means that the character can use spells listed as both Personal
                Energies and Universal Energies. The character’s spells will only be able to be utilized by tapping into
                either his personal energy or the energy of the universe around him.</dd>
            <dt id="all_energies">All Energies</dt>
            <dd>All Energies indicates that the character is able to use all of the spells.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h4>Magic Schools</h4>
        <p>
            Most mystics, magicians and sorcerers in the Marvel Universe follow a specific school of magic. Magic
            schools are divided into three general types: magic for the establishment of order in the dimensions
            (usually referred to as “white” or “good” magic); magic for the breakdown of order that results in chaos in
            the dimensions (usually referred to as “chaotic”, “evil”, or “black” magic; magic that neither strives for
            chaos or for order, but remains neutral in its existence (usually referred to as “neutral” or “gray” magic).
        </p>
        <p>
            Each magic school is more complicated than the definitions above. Each school includes concepts of nature
            and the character’s place in it, guidelines on what entities to entreat if dimensional magic is being used,
            and goals to strive for. Furthermore, despite the general tendency of each school (“white”, “gray”, black”)
            each school contains sorcerers who violate the principles of the school, much as Baron Mordo violated the
            teachings of the Ancient One by using evil magic. Such renegade magic wielders usually become outcasts from
            their original schools, but a wise sorcerer should always beware of them.
        </p>
        <p>
            The major schools of magic are listed below. Unlike the other Steps, random selection is not involved; the
            Judge should allow each player to choose his school of magic. The Judge should not interfere in a player’s
            choice unless he believes that the chosen school of magic has no place in his campaign. A random system for
            school choice is included only for those players who have no preference in schools. A player should not be
            forced to play a character with a school that is not interesting to the player.
        </p>
        <p>
            A better feel for the different schools of magic, and of magic overall, can be obtained from reading the
            Miscellany of Mysticism.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most schools have strengths and vulnerabilities listed in their brief descriptions. These are guidelines for
            the Judge to determine when a character’s magic may receive bonuses (+1CS, extra Psyche FEAT roll, etc.) or
            penalties (-1CS, no Psyche FEAT roll, etc.)
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt id="magic_for_chaos">Magic for Chaos</dt>
            <dd>This is a forbidden or dangerous type of magical school whose goal is to promote chaos, which will lead
                to an evil tyranny. One of the primary subschools of “chaotic” magic is one that follows the
                little-known archaic rituals and beliefs based on the existence of the Elder Gods. This type of magic is
                much more powerful in certain settings (such as ancient temples to the unknown gods) and with the use of
                “chaotic” magic artifacts. The vulnerability of “chaotic” magic is that it tends to attract “white”
                magic wielders or creatures who wish to negate it.</dd>
            <dt id="druidic_magic">Druidic Magic</dt>
            <dd>This school practices Celtic earth magic, drawing strength from the powers of nature. It is particularly
                powerful in natural Earth settings, but has a special vulnerability to iron or steel. It is a “neutral”
                magic school.</dd>
            <dt id="voodoo_magic">Voodoo Magic</dt>
            <dd>This is a school derived from the Loa, the spirit-gods of voodoo, a faith originated and practiced in
                Haiti. The character is most likely a houngan, or voodoo priest. Voodoo magic is particularly effective
                in its homeland and in locations of the dead. It has no special vulnerabilities and is considered a
                “white” magic, but can be perverted into a chaotic magic.</dd>
            <dt id="faerie_magic">Faerie Magic</dt>
            <dd>This school is based on the practices of the faerie, an ancient race of beings with supernatural powers
                who originated in an extradimensional world that borders upon Britain and Ireland on Earth. This magic
                school is similar to the Druidic school, except that a character in this school most likely possesses
                faerie blood. This makes him extremely powerful when wielding an ancient faerie artifact or in Britain
                or Ireland, but extremely vulnerable to iron or steel.</dd>
            <dt id="atlantean_magic">Atlantean Magic</dt>
            <dd>This school was established eons ago in the ancient Earth civilization of Atlantis. Little is known
                about the school, except that Dakimh the Enchanter, last disciple of the Atlantean sorceress Zhered-Na,
                practices it and is now the mentor of Jennifer Kale. Atlantean magic seems to be a “white” magic, that
                which draws upon the powers of order. Therefore, it can be very powerful if used in conjunction with
                “white” magical artifacts or against chaotic magic. Vulnerability would exist in the fact that chaotic
                magical creatures would be constantly trying to find and neutralize a wielder of “white” magic.</dd>
            <dt id="scientific_magic">Scientific Magic</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    This is a school that has no particular philosophy or ethical background. Magic is regarded not as a
                    way of life, but rather as a tactic used to attain one’s goal. Followers of this school are seldom
                    spellcasters themselves, but rather combine elements of magic with obscure or highly advanced forms
                    of science to create effects that seem magical. In this school, the distinction between science and
                    magic is never clear; either or both could be used to produce a single effect. Alchemy is the best
                    example of a semi-magical science. The character, such as Diablo, would be an alchemist, that is, he
                    brings about his effects through the use of potions, powders, and pills he himself creates
                    (sometimes through materials or energy tapped from dimensional or universal sources). A scientific
                    sorcerer is somewhat vulnerable (his items and creations can be destroyed or stolen, robbing him of
                    power; or he could run out of items whereas spells are usually always available). However, a
                    scientific spellcaster is somewhat less restricted in what he can accomplish (add three more spells,
                    2 of Personal energy and 1 of Universal energy to his capabilities, in artificial forms, of course).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The time required to gather materials and create new items, powders, potions, or tablets are left to
                    the Judge and depend on the spell, how strong it is and what its effects are. It is suggested that
                    times with effects of Remarkable rank or less can be created at the rate of 2 per day, while items
                    up to Amazing rank can be produced at the rate of 1 per day. The creation of items with greater
                    effect, or the creation of any permanent item requires the equivalent of a ceremony and must be
                    handled by the Judge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A scientific magic wielder begins his career with access to his master’s laboratory, which is
                    stocked with equipment whose cost in resource points equals at least 20 times the master’s Psyche
                    rank number. The magic wielder can use his master’s lab as long as the master agrees. If the student
                    wishes to set up his own lab, he only needs to spend 10 times his Psyche rank number in resource
                    points for equipment (the master makes up the difference). The Judge should use the guidelines on
                    ceremonies and ceremonial areas to handle the creation of items in laboratories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A scientific magic wielder automatically receives one scientific talent of his choice (such as
                    engineering, biology, genetics, physics, etc.) in addition to any other talents he may normally
                    receive. The automatic talent received by alchemists is pharmacy (the mixture and preparation of
                    medicines).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Scientific magic is a “neutral” school, and no special bonuses or vulnerabilities apply to it.
                </p>
            </dd>
            <dt id="special_realm_or_pantheon">Special Realm or Pantheon</dt>
            <dd>This is a school usually reserved for non-player characters, but can be the basis for a player character
                if carefully defined by a Judge. The magical teachings and spells come from the history of a Special
                Realm or Pantheon of the Marvel Universe (such as Asgard or Olympus). Bonuses for this type of magic
                would come with the use of items or spells developed by this pantheon or realm, and when at certain
                locations (Greece for the Olympian pantheon, etc.) Penalties would exist as items or locations that
                exist to destroy the specific pantheon or realm (an Asgardian character casting a spell while in the
                hostile realm of Muspelheim would have a -1CS penalty.</dd>
            <dt>“Nature” Magic</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    This important school of magic is sometimes splintered off into more specialized and defined
                    schools, such as the Druidic and Faerie schools. The belief surrounding all nature schools is that
                    all of nature is sacred and is bound together as one. Therefore it is magic given towards order,
                    though some of its splinter schools tend towards neutral magic in a belief that nature should be
                    balanced between order and chaos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The bonuses that accompany a nature school are in the form of greater effect upon and communication
                    with nature, especially animals. Most spells rolled for this school would be similar to those used
                    by Shaman (see Book 3): controlling elements, animal control, and so forth. The penalties include
                    drawing the attention of chaotic creatures and characters who desire to destroy nature and the
                    Earth.
                </p>
            </dd>
            <dt id="magic_for_order">Magic for Order</dt>
            <dd>This is the school to which Earth’s former Sorcerer Supreme, the Ancient One, and Earth’s current
                Sorcerer Supreme, Doctor Strange, belong. It is the most powerful “white” school of magic, striving for
                order and good by practicing an ascetic, disciplined approach that has its foundations deeply rooted in
                Eastern philosophy and magic. It is currently the strongest form of magic on Earth. The bonuses attached
                to this type of school are the various magical characters that Doctor Strange has managed to ally with
                over the years and the vast knowledge that Doctor Strange, and others of the same bent, can teach a good
                pupil. The penalties include Doctor Strange’s enemies, who are numerous and powerful.</dd>
            <dt id="eclectic_magic">Eclectic Magic</dt>
            <dd>This is an unorganized school of magic, that is, it follows no one school of philosophy but is a
                hodge-podge of “get-as-get-can” magic. It is considered neutral magic. Many of those who “dabble” in
                magic, and are not up to the level of a Marvel super hero, usually wind up with this type of magic. A
                spell learned here, an enchantment discovered there, makes up the whole of their philosophy. The bonus
                with this is that there is very little to bind the character (enemies, rituals, obligations, etc.), the
                penalty with this type of magic is that there is no one to learn from in a complete and comprehensive
                manner; thus advancement can be very slow.</dd>

        <h3 id="magical_energies">Magical Energies</h3>
        <p>
            What energies a magic-wielder draws upon is decided at the outset of the character’s creation. Magical
            energy can be drawn from three different sources: personal, universal, and dimensional. Each source of
            energy yields a slightly different form of magic, although it is easy to achieve the same result using
            different sources. Most magic-wielding characters have more than one source that they have learned to
            tap into. Learning the differences between these energies is the key to being an efficient
            magic-wielder.
        </p>
        <dt id="personal_energies">Personal Energies</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                Personal Energies are derived from the personal energy of the character’s soul/mind/body. This
                energy fuels any power or spell that affects the caster himself or a willing subject; trances,
                astral form, thought projections, physical alterations, and so forth can all use personal energy.

                Dimensional Energies are used by tapping beings or objects of power dwelling in mystical dimensions,
                tangential to our own. This form of energy is the least wearing upon the user. The sorcerer may only
                use these energies for powerful spells, groups of spells, or to ask for things that the being or
                aspect called upon would and/or could provide. The dimensional energies are usually gained by the
                recitation of spells, either ritualized ones found in various mystical texts or by original spells
                invoking extra-dimensional assistance. If calling upon an extradimensional being it is important to
                remember that the magic-wielder makes himself known to the being he is calling, and often to other
                magic-wielding beings powerful enough to monitor the use of dimensional energy.

                    If the caster makes a successful spell rank FEAT roll, he can take on the properties of any material
                    he touches, giving him the Strength, Endurance, and body armor equivalent to the material rank of
                    the object he touched. (For example, if he grabbed a steel girder, he would gain Remarkable
                    Strength, Endurance, and body armor.) Each time the hero changes form, adjust his Health to the new
                    sum of his Fighting, Agility, Strength, and Endurance. minus Health points he previously lost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The caster’s Strength and Endurance are limited to a maximum of Amazing, even if the object touched
                    has a higher material rank. He can remain in his transformed state as long as he wishes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the object touched is holding or emitting energy (such as red-hot metal, etc.) he absorbs the
                    energy properties as well. He absorbs the energy immediately, thereby gaining body armor equal to
                    the damage it would cause. The caster is not hurt by the energy he absorbs. He can retain absorbed
                    energy for a maximum of 10 rounds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The caster can also absorb physical properties of an object. If he touches a spiked mace, he will
                    get both the strength of iron and spikes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is also a negative side to this absorption spell. When a caster absorbs a material’s
                    properties, it tends to slow his movement and reactions down proportionately. The higher the rank,
                    the slower the character. For every material rank above Good that the caster absorbs, subtract a
                    rank from his normal Endurance for the purposes of determining his movement rate. A magic wielder in
                    a “hardened” state (material rank of Good or higher) is limited to one spell per round and his
                    spells always take effect at the end of the round.

                    The caster can direct enchanted energy at any locked door or container and it will easily open for
                    him, no matter how many locks it has or how big or intricate they are, if his spell rank FEAT roll
                    is successful.

                    The caster can mystically alter his face and body structure at will. He does
                    this through the complete control he has over his muscles, ligaments, tissues, and skin. By
                    manipulating these he can resemble almost anyone he wishes who is human. He even has control of his
                    hair, making lengthen or shorten at will. If the new shape and face he is turning into is not vastly
                    different from his own, he can change easily and completely in one round. If the change is extreme
                    (very thin to obese, man to woman, adult to child, etc.) the caster must make a successful spell
                    rank FEAT roll to change, and the transformation will take two rounds.

                    The caster can magically alter his body to grow claws, fangs, or spines.
                    This can be done in one round (he must make a successful power rank FEAT roll if he is distracted or
                    under stress). When attacking, the sorcerer can use his Fighting rank or this spell rank, whichever
                    he prefers. Damage equals the hero’s Strength rank +1CS, and attacks are resolved on the Bite-Claw
                    column of the Magic Effects Table.

                    The caster can magically alter all of the bones in the body. They become malleable and the muscle
                    tissue is exceedingly resilient, making his body very flexible and pliant. It is impossible to break
                    a bone or tear a muscle. His flexibility enables him to slither into and out of very tight and small
                    places. He can fit into any hole or slot down to eight inches diameter. Apply a +2CS to Strength
                    ability for purposes of Escaping a hold when grappled. The caster must make a successful spell rank
                    FEAT roll if distracted or under stress.

                    The caster can enchant an inanimate object to become animate and control its movements. The object
                    must be of a material rank that is less than or equal to this spell rank. Only one object at a time
                    can be animated and, while it must be within the area of effect to animate, it can continue to be
                    animated outside of the area of effect, if within the caster’s sight. If the caster causes an
                    animate object under his control to attack an opponent, the animated object’s Fighting and Agility
                    are equal to the caster’s spell rank, but the item’s material rank determines its Strength,
                    Endurance, and damage inflicted. The caster must concentrate on controlling the object. No item over
                    the size of a car can be animated, regardless of the caster’s spell rank.

                <p>
                    The caster can mystically make his body non-corporeal and become an apparition. (This should not be
                    confused with Astral Projection, as that power takes the caster to another dimension and he is
                    invisible to most characters in this dimension.) Once the spell is cast, the caster need not
                    concentrate upon his state to remain an apparition. As an apparition, the caster can still move,
                    speak, cast spells, and perform most other normal actions. His movement rate is the same as if he
                    were corporeal, but he can walk on air, sink through floors, climb up elevations as if he were
                    climbing stairs, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a caster becomes an apparition his body loses its density, allowing him to pass through solid
                    object and letting solid objects pass through him. The caster can be seen, but is obviously not
                    completely solid. This power grants the caster body armor equal to the spell rank against any
                    physical, energy, or mental attacks. If the apparition/caster physically attacks another character,
                    that character must also be treated as though he has body armor equal to this spell rank. Magical,
                    mental, or energy attacks against the target are treated as normal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To pass through a solid object, or have a solid object pass through him, the object’s material rank
                    must be equal to or less than the spell rank. In addition, the caster can lower the density of an
                    object he touches by making a spell rank FEAT roll and, if succeeding, keeping it in his possession.

                    <i>Judge’s Note:</i> If the player wishes to make a concentrated effort at creating a character who
                    appears like a ghost, striking fear and terror into criminal hearts, then the Judge should keep this
                    effect in mind when the caster walks through a wall, drops through a ceiling, etc. and faces anyone.
                    A character encountering this apparition, especially for the first time, must make a Psyche FEAT
                    roll (see Magic Effects Table) or react as described in the Fear power. There is a price the caster
                    has to pay for this extra “power”, however. This frightening effect on people only works if the
                    caster is not famous, thus cutting off his Popularity and some sources of Karma gain. He must remain
                    relatively reclusive and unknown so the criminal element does not recognize him.

                    The caster can summon magical body armor equal to this spell rank. There is a 75% chance that the
                    body armor will affect the caster’s appearance. The stronger the armor, the more his appearance will
                    be affected. The actual appearance is to be determined by the Judge and player. This spell reduces
                    the character’s Agility by one rank.

                    The caster can separate his astral self-the sheath of his life essence-from his physical self and
                    travel through space unbound by physical laws while retaining human consciousness. The astral form
                    (also sometimes called the ethereal form or the ectoplasmic form) is invisible, intangible, and
                    incapable of being harmed except by the most powerful magic or by opponents who are themselves in
                    astral form. If the caster wishes to project his astral self while under duress, during a combat or
                    while he is being mentally attacked, he must make his spell rank FEAT roll.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The duration of effect determines how long the caster can remain in this form without physical
                    deterioration occurring to his physical form. If the astral form does not return to its physical
                    body before the duration of effect has elapsed, the caster’s body dies; and the astral form can only
                    enter it as it would any other corpse or dummy, creating a blind, zombie-like creature. If the
                    caster’s body is destroyed while the astral form is projecting, the caster is stranded in his astral
                    form.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a character is stranded in his astral form due to the death of his physical body, the astral form
                    itself will dissolve after an amount of time equal to the normal spell duration associated with the
                    character’s Psyche rank. (For example, the astral form of a character with Incredible Psyche would
                    endure for one day; the astral form of someone with an Unearthly Psyche would last indefinitely.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    The caster can transport other willing subjects to the astral plane along with himself. When
                    attempting to do so, he must make a Psyche FEAT roll: a white or green result means that the caster
                    traveled and the other(s) did not, a yellow or red result means that the multiple astral travel
                    worked perfectly. Astral projection cannot affect someone against his will.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Characters who are in their astral forms can see and communicate with each other, if both parties
                    desire. If one or both parties do not desire to be seen, they may have to hide behind solid items,
                    just as if they were in their physical form. If the astral character who is seeking has a lower
                    power rank than the astral character who is attempting to avoid being seen, he must make a Psyche
                    FEAT roll, even if that character is in plain, astral view. If seen, they can have magical combat in
                    that form.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Magical items, though left behind on the physical plane, also have a counterpart that can be taken
                    into the astral plane. It acts in the same manner as its physical counterpart, but its powers are
                    lessened by one rank on the astral plane. Any magic item that the character possesses on the
                    physical plane can be controlled by the owner’s astral self. (For example, Doctor Strange has
                    escaped innumerable traps by controlling his Cloak of Levitation and the Eye of Agamotto within his
                    amulet, while he was in his astral form.).

                    This spell manifests itself in a variety of ways, as the caster chooses: vapors, rings, threads,
                    circles, and so on. When the caster calls up this enchantment, bands (or whatever) form around the
                    target and entrap him. It takes a full round for the bands to completely form. The target can try to
                    dodge through the bands only in the round in which they form and only if the area being entrapped is
                    as large as a 10 foot cube. If the spell is directed at the individual himself, he cannot dodge
                    through it. When a character is surrounded by the bands there is a 75% chance that he is bound, a
                    25% chance that he is gagged, and a 10% chance that he is blinded (seethe Bound, Gag, & Blind rule
                    in the Miscellany of Mysticism). A separate roll is made for each of these effects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The bands cause no damage to the entrapped character. Bands have a material rank that is equal to
                    the caster’s Psyche rank. While normal attacks Will not affect bands, magical attacks may free the
                    victim. If the magic attack’s spell rank is higher than the bands material rank, it will shatter the
                    bands if the attacker makes a green FEAT roll. If the material rank is the same rank as the magical
                    attack, the attacker must make a successful yellow FEAT roll to shatter the bands. If the material
                    rank is higher than the spell rank of the magical attack, the attacker needs a successful red FEAT
                    roll to break the bands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The caster does not have to maintain a high level of concentration to maintain the bands; he can
                    move, cast spells, perform normal actions, etc. However, if the caster is affected by a hostile
                    attack or spell, he must make a successful Psyche FEAT roll to keep the bands from breaking. Bands
                    automatically break if the caster is rendered unconscious.

                    be noticed, any opponent must make a successful Yellow Intuition FEAT roll to see him. The color
                    change can be performed in one round. If the caster is under stress or distracted (being attacked,
                    etc.) he must make a successful spell rank FEAT roll to change.

                    The caster creates a pleasant aura about himself, charming opponents in the area of effect. Every
                    opponent in the area is allowed a Psyche FEAT roll (see Magic Effects Table). If the target is
                    affected, he will quickly change his mind about attacking the caster because “there is just
                    something about him he likes”; if the Psyche FEAT result is “No Effect”, the target is not even
                    aware that the caster tried to charm him. A charmed target will not attack the caster, but will
                    attack another opponent, if one is available. The caster cannot give orders of any kind to a charmed
                    character; the spell is not a form of mental control.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A charmed target is allowed to make a Psyche FEAT roll each round to attempt to break the charm.
                    Each charmed opponent must break the charm on his own; he cannot be persuaded that he is charmed by
                    friends, although a counterspell cast by a friend might break the charm. Unless the charm is broken,
                    it will remain in effect for the duration of the spell, even if the caster leaves. A charmed
                    character will not remember that he has been charmed once the spell expires.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the caster attacks an opponent charmed by his spell, the spell is automatically broken, and the
                    target retains full memories of being charmed and remembers who is responsible.

                    The effects of this spell are unpredictable, but can be devastating. When it is cast, all targets
                    within the area of effect receive a Psyche FEAT roll to avoid the effect. If a target fails the
                    roll, he is affected by the confusion. The Judge rolls a die for each affected target and checks <a

                    This spell is used to teleport an item, plant, creature or character from its current location to
                    the caster’s location. This spell can even restore a broken or decayed item to its original form
                    while in the act of teleporting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If conjuring a trivial item, plant, or harmless animal, the caster need make no FEAT roll, it simply
                    appears.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If conjuring a complex or dangerous item, plant, or dangerous creature, or attempting to conjure a
                    broken or decayed item, the caster must make a successful spell rank FEAT roll before it appears.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If conjuring forth a willing character (teammate, friend, etc.) the caster must make both a
                    successful spell rank FEAT roll and a successful Psyche FEAT roll before the character appears.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If conjuring forth an unwilling character, the caster must make a successful spell rank FEAT roll.
                    The subject is allowed a Psyche FEAT roll to resist being brought forth; if the resistance FEAT is
                    successful, the conjuration fails.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The conjuration of the body of a dead character is far beyond the abilities of any caster who does
                    not have an Unearthly spell rank in this spell. The conjure spell only summons or recreates the
                    physical body; however, if the dead character’s astral form survives (see the Astral Projection
                    spell), it can reanimate the body, restoring it to true life.

                <p>
                    With this spell, the caster can weave an enchanted curse around an opponent. If the spell rank FEAT
                    roll is successful, the curse will remain with the opponent for the duration of effect. The duration
                    of this spell is unusual; a curse cannot exceed Amazing duration (one month), even if the caster’s
                    spell rank exceeds Amazing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a curse is attempted, the target can avoid it by making a successful Psyche FEAT roll. If the
                    curse takes effect, the victim can make one Psyche FEAT roll per day to attempt to break it; a
                    successful FEAT roll means the curse is broken. The target will not know who attacked him,
                    regardless of whether or not the curse is successfully cast.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A curse negatively modifies all of the opponent’s actions and spells by a 1 Column Shift (plus or
                    minus, as long as it works against the opponent). No more than one curse can normally be placed on a
                    character. The exception is the use of the Link spell, whereby up to two curses can be placed on one
                    opponent, but they cannot, totally, exceed the effect of a -2 Column Shift modifier lasting one
                    month.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Judge can decide to allow curses that have different effects instead of column shifts, such as:
                    temporary aging; warts and boils; etc., but no curse can cause the death of a character.

                    This spell enables the caster’s body to absorb without harm some of the damage from energy attacks,
                    both magical and non-magical. The character is still vulnerable to physical, missile, and mental
                    attacks. The spell rank indicates how much damage will be absorbed per round before the caster is
                    harmed (i.e., a Remarkable rank would prevent the first 30 points of damage from an energy attack).
                </p>

            <dd>
                <p>
                    The spell enables the caster to magically absorb kinetic energy and convert it to physical Strength
                    and Health. Whenever the character is physically attacked (slugfest, bite-claw attacks, missile
                    weapons, charging, concussive rays, but not energy attacks or grappling, he may make a spell rank
                    FEAT roll. If he fails the roll, then that damage is dealt with as normal that round. If the FEAT is
                    successful, the appropriate amount of damage is immediately added to his Health, instead of
                    subtracted as damage. In this fashion, the caster’s Health can go as high as 200. In addition, the
                    caster’s Strength is raised to the same rank as the attack, if the attack’s rank is higher.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the caster using this spell also has some form of body armor, the attack is reduced by the body
                    armor before the caster makes his absorption FEAT roll; the caster can attempt to absorb whatever
                    points of damage remain. The caster’s Strength is increased if the points remaining in the attack
                    exceed the rank number of his current Strength rank.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If he wishes, after the caster stores up 100 points he may try another spell rank FEAT roll. A
                    successful roll allows him to redirect this energy by using all of his newly gained Strength to
                    inflict a blow of up to Monstrous damage. If the roll fails, he just keeps storing up damage. This
                    energy dissipates in 10 rounds in any event. Any damage done to him after he reaches a Health of 200
                    begins to subtract from that number, until he reaches 0 Health or makes his spell rank roll again to
                    add to his energy converted Health.

                <p>
                    The caster can control the density of another living creature or an
                    inanimate object. He must point at the target and make an Agility FEAT roll for targeting. A living
                    target can attempt to Dodge. If the caster’s FEAT roll succeeds, he has control over the molecular
                    cohesion of the target.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The caster can reduce or increase the density of the target by one rank each round. The caster must
                    concentrate on the target, so the caster cannot attack or cast other spells while using this spell.
                    If the caster stops concentrating on the target, it will stay at its present density rank for the
                    duration of the spell, then begin returning to normal, shifting one rank per round until its normal
                    density rank is restored.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For each rank that a living target’s density is reduced, apply a -1CS to the target’s Strength.
                    Furthermore, anyone attacked by the target is considered to have body armor equivalent to the
                    target’s current density rank. If the target’s density is reduced to Shift 0 rank, his body becomes
                    a cloudy form, like a thick fog, up to two areas in volume. In cloud form, the target is subject to
                    strong wind currents, suction, etc. The target cannot attack or cast spells in this form and has no
                    control over his movement. The cloud cannot be attacked by physical or energy means.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For each rank that a target’s density is increased, he gains body armor equivalent to his current
                    density. If his current density is higher than his Strength, he inflicts damage in combat equal to
                    his density rank. If the target’s current density rank is higher than his Endurance, apply a -1CS to
                    his Fighting and Agility for each rank that his density exceeds his Endurance; also apply a -1CS to
                    his Endurance for purposes of determining his movement rate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The target’s weight at its current density rank is equal to the weight that a person with the same
                    Strength rank could lift. Increasing the density of an intricate object, such as a plant or complex
                    machine, might cause thin and delicate parts to break off.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For purposes of this spell, most living targets have Typical density in their normal state. However,
                    some races have greater density which provides them with body armor (such as Asgardians and
                    Olympians); use the body armor rank of these beings as their normal density. Inanimate objects have
                    normal density equal to their material rank.

                    This spell is the same as the Density Control-Others spell, except that the caster has full control
                    over his cloud-form at Shift 0 density. The caster can surround others with his cloud-form,
                    obscuring their vision. The caster also has a limited ability to fly, at a maximum speed of 2 areas
                    per round.The caster can also seep under doors, through crack, etc., while in cloud-form.

                    This spell causes a temporary opening in the dimension’s fabric, allowing the caster to cross from
                    one dimension to another. Look for the section on Dimensions in the Miscellany of Mysticism for more
                    detail. The caster can automatically open a portal to a dimension with which he is familiar, but
                    opening a portal to an unfamiliar dimension requires a successful spell rank FEAT roll. If a FEAT
                    roll is required, failure indicates that the caster cannot enter the desired dimension that day A
                    beginning caster who does not really know one dimension from another can stumble into any one of
                    them at random.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A spellcaster who is in a familiar foreign dimension can automatically return to his home dimension.
                    However, if the caster is in an unfamiliar dimension or if his mind has been affected by traveling
                    in a sanity-bending or sanity-threatening dimension, the caster must make a successful spell rank
                    FEAT roll to locate the dimensional position of his home dimension. This roll to return is only
                    allowed once per week. However, the caster can enter another random dimension and try to go home
                    from there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the caster tries to take anyone else with him into a dimension, whether they are willing or
                    unwilling, then a Psyche FEAT roll is required of each character passing through into the dimension,
                    every time they enter a new dimension. Anyone who fails the FEAT roll cannot pass through that
                    particular dimensional aperture at this time. Characters who are left behind can try again a day
                    later, if the aperture is still in effect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This spell also grants the caster knowledge of a tiny “personal dimension” where he can go with
                    perfect accuracy and safety. This pocket dimension is only accessible from the caster’s home
                    dimension and contains no dangerous creatures. There the caster can go for peace, solitude, and can
                    even make it a home away from home. The caster can enter or leave his own little dimension once per
                    day.

                    This spell makes the character one with a magic wielder from the past. There are two separate
                    personality patterns in the magic wielder’s brain, and the character has at least partial access to
                    the memories and knowledge of his ancient counterpart.

                <p>
                    The way in which the character relates to his alter-ego is left to the Judge. Some suggestions
                    include: the alter-ego may exist inside or as part of a magical item the character owns; the
                    alter-ego may be an astral form that inhabits the character’s body or is visible to him alone; the
                    alter ego may exist in a specific location which is t e only place where the character may
                    communicate with him; etc. The Judge must decide whether or not the ancient spellcaster has some
                    physical form.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the character casts this spell, the alter-ego is a predecessor from the caster’s own school of
                    magic. If the alter-ego is discovered by accident, it might not be friendly to the caster.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While the two are joined, the player character has a strong resistance to all mental probes and
                    attacks, magic or otherwise. This resistance is in the form of a +2CS in the caster’s favor when
                    FEAT rolls are allowed to ignore or defend against mental controls and attacks (not to exceed
                    Monstrous rank).
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the Judge so decides, the other persona might battle for control of the character’s body.
                    Circumstances under which could happen include: the caster is in danger of immediate death; the
                    goals and values of the character are different from those of the alter-ego; the character is
                    visiting a location associated with the alter ego in his lifetime; the caster attempts to use a
                    spell or ability available to the alter ego but not available to himself, etc. An entirely new magic
                    wielding character can even be rolled up and it might exchange places with the caster on such
                    occasions, or just give timely advice.

                This spell unleashes a magical beam or bolt causing damage equal to the spell
                rank (a beam is a continuous line of energy, a bolt is an interrupted line of energy). A beam or
                bolt (hereafter referred to as bolt) affects only one target in the target area. When this spell is
                obtained, the player should roll a die to see where the bolts originate. The bolts will issue forth
                from the character’s: 1-4 = Hands; 5-8 = Eyes; 9 = Chest; 10 = Forehead. The type of bolt the
                character uses will be one of the following, which the player chooses with the approval of the

                            This bolt uses the Darkforce, a form of energy from another dimension. The target loses
                            Health
                            points equal to the caster’s spell rank. The bolt is black. (This bolt requires dimensional
                            energy;
                            it is not available to characters unable to use dimensional energy.)

                            This bolt disintegrates non-living, inanimate objects up to 2 areas away from the caster.
                            The limit
                            of what it can disintegrate is determined by the spell rank. Compare the spell rank to the
                            material
                            rank of the object to be disintegrated.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the material rank is higher than the spell rank, the target’s material strength is
                            reduced one
                            rank.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the material rank is equal to or less than the spell rank, the target is disintegrated.
                            Small
                            objects (fist-sized, for example) can be destroyed automatically. Destroying man-sized
                            objects
                            requires a successful yellow spell rank FEAT roll. Destroying larger objects (like a
                            vehicle)
                            requires a successful red FEAT roll. If the target is an object of no importance, the Judge
                            can
                            waive the FEAT roll and rule that the item is automatically destroyed.

                    This spell unleashes a magical blast, causing damage equal to the spell rank to everything in the
                    target area. In addition, the blast has a chance to slam or stun anyone within the target area (see
                    the Magic Effects Table under Power Rank- Blasting). The caster’s Psyche is reduced to Typical for
                    an hour afterwards and he will pass out for 1-10 rounds unless he makes a successful Endurance FEAT
                    roll. The type of blast used by the character is decided by the Judge and player when the character
                    obtains the spell (see Eldritch Beams/Bolts for possible types).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The spell rank determines the amount of damage done by the blast, but the area of effect when the
                    spell is obtained has a maximum rank of Excellent (one area), even if the caster’s actual spell rank
                    is higher. The area of effect can be increased through experience, but can never exceed the spell
                    rank. Furthermore, this spell has a maximum limit of Amazing rank for its area of effect.

                    The caster can direct Mystical energy into a breath attack, similar to Eldritch Beams/Bolts or an
                    Eldritch Blast, but issuing forth from the mouth, He can still verbally communicate, taste, etc. The
                    type of damaging breath is up to the Judge and player (see Eldritch Beams/ Bolts for suggestions).

                    The caster unleashes a stream or swarm of magical crystals that will bombard a target upon his
                    command. The crystals will appear, attack the target, cause physical damage equal to the spell rank,
                    then disappear. These are physical manifestations of magic and are affected by defenses that protect
                    the target from physical damage (body armor, force fields, battlesuits, bullet-proof clothing,
                    etc.). The crystals will attack only one target chosen by the caster, if there are several targets
                    in a single area.

                    The caster summons forth sorcerous flames that cause damage equal to their spell rank every round a
                    character passes through them. A spell rank FEAT roll is required to bring them forth. The flames
                    are summoned forth in a fixed location, designated by the caster, and cannot be moved. The flames
                    are used as a fiery wall to block movement into or out of the target area. They extend along one
                    side of the target area chosen by the caster and can be any height chosen by the caster, from a few
                    feet to three stories. The wall of flames can be slightly bent by the caster to accommodate
                    structures and obstacles. No more than three walls can ever be maintained by the caster at any one
                    time.

                    The caster can magically control the emotions of others, but the caster must establish some link
                    with the target, such as gazing into the target’s eyes or talking to the target for a brief moment.
                    The caster must make a successful spell rank FEAT roll to establish control (see the Magic Effects
                    Table under Psyche-Mental Control, treat a successful roll by the caster as a hold). This spell can
                    only affect a single target in the area of effect. The target is allowed a Psyche FEAT roll to
                    attempt to resist this form of mental control. If the target fails his resistance FEAT roll, his
                    emotions are under the caster’s control and subject to the caster’s suggestions. The caster can
                    summon love, fear, hate, etc. and force his foe to react to those emotions. These emotional
                    upheavals override the target’s normal emotional inclination. The caster may only “summon” one
                    strong emotion at a time and only control one target at a time. The duration for the emotional
                    control is the duration of the spell (Table 0.1). When the spell expires, the victim regains his
                    normal emotional reactions.

                    The caster can magically sense another character or group’s strong emotions (not thoughts). This
                    spell not only allows the character to gain a general impression of the mood and intentions of
                    individuals or groups, it also allows him to broadcast his emotions to an individual or group.
                    Broadcasting emotional attitudes like friendship, love, caution, helpfulness, and so forth can
                    sometimes prove invaluable in clearing up a misunderstanding. The character cannot broadcast these
                    emotions unless he truly feels them. These feelings should help dictate his actions. Only one
                    attempt at it can be made per encounter. By using this spell, especially on animals, the caster can
                    sense whether the target is deathly afraid, slightly afraid, in love, full of hate, etc. and the
                    object of their hate, love, fear, and so on.

                    The caster creates an enchanted eye when he wishes. The caster can automatically summon the
                    enchanted eye for one round only. A successful spell rank FEAT roll brings the eye forth for the
                    full duration of the spell. It can only see as far as sight normally would, but can penetrate
                    darkness (real or magical), show the caster mystical existences (such as astral projections,
                    invisible magical objects, mystical shields, and so on), and see through illusions. The caster is
                    mentally linked with the eye and sees everything it sees.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The enchanted eye is a separate magical creation capable of flight. Its movement rate is the same as
                    that of the caster. The maximum distance it can be be separate from the caster is based on the spell
                    rank (for example, 12 areas for Amazing rank.) The eye can be attacked physically or magically; the
                    eye has Health points equal to the caster’s Psyche and any FEAT roll the eye is required to make use
                    the caster’s appropriate ability rank. The caster is not affected by any damage suffered by the
                    enchanted eye.

                    The caster can use his personal, universal, or dimensional energy to control another type of
                    nonmagical energy (not personal, universal, or dimensional). This energy manipulation requires a
                    successful spell rank FEAT roll. Only one type of energy can be chosen by a beginning caster, but
                    with advancement he may learn to control other forms of energy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The caster can affect all of the individual type of energy within his area of effect with ease:
                    turning it on or off, making it overload, siphoning it where he chooses, etc. He can channel
                    controlled energy around himself so as not to be harmed by it.

                    The caster must make a successful red spell rank FEAT roll to use this spell offensively. The attack

                    number.

                    The Darkforce is a semisentient force from another dimension. It can be used to black out an area so
                    completely that even infravision does not work. It cannot be used as a weapon outside of the area
                    the character is occupying, but within that area anyone enveloped by the Darkforce (except the
                    caster) loses Health points equal to the caster’s spell rank number each round. Controlling the
                    Darkforce requires that the caster use dimensional energy; this form of control is not available to
                    casters who cannot use dimensional energy.

                    The caster can absorb and redirect electrical energy. One of the best uses of this spell is as an
                    electrical override. The caster can direct electrical spells to override the controls of electrical
                    equipment, including computers, alarm systems, and unshielded robots. He can either take control or
                    damage this equipment. The ability of control is equal to the spell rank.

                    The caster can reverse or intensify gravity at will. The spell can be used to move objects (use the
                    spell rank as the caster’s Strength). A character with this spell can do two gravity related actions
                    at once. When used as an attack. the caster uses the gravitational forces to seize the target in a
                    grappling-like attack. The grappling force starts with Typical Strength, but the caster can
                    automatically increase the strength by one rank each round, up to the spell rank. This requires
                    concentration on the part of the caster (no attacks or other spells cast while the gravity attack is
                    in effect). The target must make a successful Strength FEAT roll to escape the effect.

                    Reverse gravity can only be lowered to Shift 0, whereby the target can float a few feet above the

                    blind a victim. A light barrier does not defend against damage, but no one can see through it and it
                    scares off unintelligent animals and creatures.

                    to. He feels no non-magical cold or heat and can survive in outer space, under water, within the
                    earth, in hostile atmospheres, etc. This spell does not provide protection from or immunity to
                    attack, but it does allow the caster to survive in conditions where survival would normally be
                    impossible. The area of spell is usually just around the caster himself, though the aura can contain
                    an additional character for every rank of the caster’s Psyche above Remarkable.

                <p>
                    This is a particularly long-lived spell, often used by magic wielders stranded in hostile
                    circumstances or alien dimensions. The duration of this spell is left to the Judge, as different
                    conditions and circumstances (time passage in other dimensions for example) can affect the duration.
                    It is suggested that the caster receive a +3CS on the duration of the spell. (For example, the spell
                    would have a Unearthly duration for a caster with an Incredible spell rank.) An Unearthly duration
                    means that the spell lasts indefinitely, usually until the caster escapes from the hostile
                    conditions that caused him to cast the spell.

                    This spell affects all targets in the area of effect. The spell releases an unreasoning fear from
                    the target’s mind. All targets are allowed a Psyche FEAT roll to resist the effect (see the Magic
                    Effects Table). If the target misses the roll, the frightened character wants nothing more than to
                    run away and hide (all his actions while afraid are at -2CS). The victim will try to avoid, or if
                    necessary attack, anyone attempting to stop or restrain him. The character can only perform actions
                    (including spellcasting) that will help him to escape. The victim always flees away from the
                    attacker, even if he cannot see the caster. After the first three rounds of being afraid, and every
                    other round after that, if need be, the frightened character is allowed a Psyche FEAT roll to regain
                    his composure. Once made, it will still take him a full round to get complete control of himself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though the caster must maintain a high degree of concentration on this spell to keep the target
                    afraid (no attacks or other spellcasting allowed), he does not know when the character breaks the
                    spell. Only when the target attacks the caster or otherwise acts contrary to a state of fear does
                    the caster realize he no longer influences the target.

                    The caster weaves a mystical tendril around an object and sees the stress points, fracture planes,
                    or weaknesses inherent in the item. The object must be natural, not magical. If this spell is used
                    successfully, the caster can use a magical energy attack (bolt, blast, etc.), and shatter the object
                    if he gets a Bull’s-Eye result using a Targeting attack (see the Magic Effects Table), even if the
                    object’s material rank is up to three ranks higher than the spell rank. Note; This spell cannot be
                    used to shatter Class 1000 materials unless the caster’s spell rank is also Class 1000.)

                    With this spell, the caster can magically fly. The spell rank and Psyche of the caster determines
                    how fast he can fly. Consult the <a href="#table_magical_flight_speed">Magical Flight Speed
                        Table</a>, below to determine the movement rate.
                    The normal rate is the speed the character usually flies. If he wishes to achieve top rate flight he
                    must make a Psyche FEAT roll every 5 rounds. A failed roll simply drops the caster’s speed back to
                    normal.

                    The caster must make a successful spell rank FEAT roll to perform intricate flight maneuvers, fight
                    while aloft, or perform other magic while aloft. The form of flight that the individual player
                    character has (wings that magically appear, magic control of wind, or simply mystical flight) is up
                    to the player.

                    The caster can mystically predict the actions of anyone he has studied (defined as observed for at
                    least 10 rounds). This foretelling is short-term only. If he makes a successful spell rank FEAT roll
                    the caster does not have to decide what to do in that round until after the opponent(s) have
                    declared their actions, no matter who has the initiative.

                    The caster can magically effect other characters’ minds and cause them to forget events. This is
                    usually used by heroic magic wielders to protect innocent bystanders from the awesome psychic shock
                    caused by some of the sights to be seen during magical combat, etc. It is also used by most magic
                    wielding characters to protect their secret identities. Evil magicians may also use this spell to
                    cover up their trail or their crimes. The duration of the spell is permanent (unless another
                    sorcerer uses a Revival spell of at least equal spell rank to break the spell of Forgetfulness). The
                    number of people that can be ensorcelled by the spell depends on the spell rank: Good = 1 person;
                    Excellent = up to 5 people; Remarkable = everyone in I area; Incredible = everyone in a square mile;
                    Amazing = everyone in 100 square miles; Monstrous = everyone on the planet; Unearthly everyone in
                    one dimension; Class 1000 everyone in all dimensions.

                    Any character with a Psyche equal to or greater than the caster’s may make a Psyche FEAT roll to
                    reduce the effects of the spell. Magic wielding characters have a +2CS for this FEAT roll. A green
                    result means that vague recollections of the event sometimes surface in the character’s memory. A
                    yellow result means that the character knows most of the highlights of the event, but cannot
                    remember who cast the spell of forgetfulness. A red result means that the character can remember
                    everything.

                    The caster can conjure up flashing lights and swirling colors, which distract and confuse opponents.
                    The caster can cause them to appear anywhere within sight in the area of effect. Any characters in
                    that area must make a Psyche FEAT roll; if the FEAT is successful, the target is unaffected. If the
                    roll fails, the target suffers an unfavorable 1 CS on all his actions (plus or minus 1 CS depending
                    on whatever is unfavorable to the target).
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the caster desires, he can try and target the glamor on a specific character; this requires a
                    successful targeting Agility bull’s-eye FEAT roll. If successful, the target suffers an unfavorable
                    2 CS, but the spell effects that target only

                <p>
                    Once established the glamor cannot be moved out of the area or exact location it was cast upon.

                    The caster has the ability to magically learn information from an item, The caster must make a
                    successful spell rank FEAT roll to learn anything from the item (if the item is of an unfamiliar
                    alien design, the Judge can apply a -1CS to the spell rank).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first information that can be gleaned by a successful spell rank FEAT roll is what the item’s
                    purpose is and how to use it. If the caster has no talent in an area that the item might be used
                    for, then he only has a rank of Typical when using it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once an artifact’s purpose is identified another spell rank FEAT roll is allowed. If successful, it
                    allows the caster to “read” the psychic impressions left on it by the last person who used it.
                    Information that can be gained includes what the user looked like, what he thought of while using
                    it, what he was doing for the last few hours before the item was lost, stolen, or otherwise left his
                    possession, etc. The longer the item has been untouched, the dimmer the impression.

                    This spell is increased or diminished if the item is magical. If the magic is of the same school as
                    the caster, he receives a +2CS. If the magic is not of the same school as the caster, he receives a
                    -1CS. If the magic is of a school hostile to the caster, he suffers an additional -1CS.

                    The caster grows taller through this enchantment. The limit on his size is listed on the Maximum
                    Growth column in <a href="#table_magical_size_changes">Magical Size Changes Table</a>, and depends
                    on
                    the spell rank (the Shrinking spell also uses this Table). If the caster’s Strength rank is less
                    than this spell rank, he uses the spell rank as his Strength when in giant form. If the spell rank
                    is less than the caster’s Strength, the Strength is increased one rank when in giant form. Enemies
                    who attack him also get a +1 Column Shift to the right, because the caster’s great size makes him
                    easier to attack.

                    The caster has a magical spell that is almost identical to the Growing spell, but instead of being
                    able to increase his size, he can increase the size of other characters and objects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the character to be grown is willing, then the caster must make a successful spell rank FEAT roll
                    to increase his size. The character will regain his normal height after the duration of spell or
                    when the caster wishes, whichever comes first.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the character to be grown is not willing, then not only does the caster have to make a successful
                    spell rank FEAT roll but the target is allowed a Psyche F6~ roll to resist the effect. If the
                    target’s Psyche FEAT is successful, he is unaffected. It the target is affected, he will return to
                    his normal height after the duration of spell or when the caster wishes, whichever comes first.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The caster can use this spell to enlarge objects with a material rank equal to or less than this
                    spell rank. To increase an object’s size, the caster must make a spell rankFEAT roll. The object
                    will return to its normal size only after the duration of effect has lapsed.

                    This spell gives the caster such complete control over his bodily functions that he can heal himself
                    by use of personal or dimensional energy. Use the spell rank number instead of his Endurance rank
                    number to determine the maximum amount of damage healed. The caster can only perform this once per
                    day, in addition to his normal healing rate.

                    The caster can magically heal other characters by using universal or dimensional energy. The caster
                    must touch the character for two consecutive rounds after casting the spell. A successful spell rank
                    FEAT roll is required. The, maximum amount of damage that can be healed per person is the spell rank
                    number. Any individual character can only be healed once per day by a specific caster. The number of
                    different characters the caster can heal per day is equal to the spell rank number divided by 10
                    (round fractions up). If the player so desires, this spell could be used to heal a creature instead
                    of a character.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The healing is complete, including the mending of broken bones and torn cartilage. The spell is also
                    effective against disease.

                <p>
                    This spell creates an illusion in the mind of creatures within the area of effect. The player whose
                    character is using this spell must describe it to the Judge. The illusion looks, sounds, and smells
                    the way it would if it were real, but cannot cause damage. Since the illusion exists only in the
                    mind of the targets, no one outside the area of effect can see it. All characters in the area of
                    effect see the same illusion. The caster must concentrate on the illusion for the entire duration of
                    its existence to be believable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each character seeing the illusion may make a Psyche FEAT roll to disbelieve it at the beginning of
                    the illusion and every other round after that. If the FEAT roll is successful, the illusion fades
                    from his mind. Other characters with illusion creating powers, whether magical, mutant, or whatever,
                    receive a +2 Column Shift to their attempts to disbelieve. An unaffected character cannot persuade
                    an affected character of the illusion’s true nature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Characters who are affected will act as they normally would if the illusion were real. If characters
                    attack an illusion, attacks will not affect it (although the caster could make it seem otherwise);
                    the Judge will have to keep track of the attacks because of the possibility of injury to bystanders
                    or property. Items passing through an illusion may look like they are absorbed by it, like he
                    side-stepped it, or whatever else the caster desires.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the illusion is of something silly, confusing, or extremely contradictory, then the Judge should
                    secretly roll an Intuition check for those affected to disbelieve it.

                <p>
                    The caster can direct his magical energy to form an identical image of himself. For every round he
                    makes a successful spell rank FEAT roll, the image will perform as he desires, thoroughly convincing
                    most characters that the image is the caster. This belief is somewhat like the Illusion spell and
                    should be treated as an illusion for the purposes of combat or touching the image.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The caster can either use this spell while he is visible to create a “double” and confuse his
                    opponents, or he can hide or turn invisible (if he has that spell) and have the image replace him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The creation of more than one image is possible, but it requires a successful Psyche FEAT roll by
                    the caster for every image made and each image requires a successful spell rank FEAT roll by the
                    caster for each round he is commanding them. The maximum number of images a caster can create during
                    the use of this spell is the spell rank divided by 10 (round fractions up).

                    The caster mystically anchors himself to a surface, after which he is nearly an immovable object.
                    The 11 planting” takes concentration, a successful spell rank FEAT roll, and one round.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The caster gains body armor equal to the spell rank, and he cannot be Slammed or Stunned in combat
                    in any event. He can also perform magic while “planted” on a wall, ceiling, or whatever.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An attacker can destroy the surface the caster is anchored to only if the attacker’s attack rank or
                    Strength is at least two ranks above this spell rank and if the attacker makes a successful red FEAT
                    roll.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of the duration of effect, the mystical “anchor” disappears, but the caster can cancel
                    the spell earlier if he chooses.

                    This spell makes the caster invisible to others. Any item on the caster’s person and anyone holding
                    hands with him (and willing to be affected) also becomes invisible as long as they remain in contact
                    with him. This spell cannot turn an unwilling creature invisible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Being invisible causes no special problems for the caster, but anyone else affected who is not used
                    to being invisible will have a real problem moving about (movement halved), performing the simplest
                    of actions (-2CS), and fighting in any fashion (-3CS for any combat). It requires at least 10 rounds
                    of being invisible before becoming used to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note: an invisible person can be located by persons with superhuman hearing or sense of smell, or by
                    detection powers and devices that do not depend on sight.

                    With this spell the caster can make objects not on his person invisible by touching them. The size
                    of the object must be equal to or less than that of a medium-sized car. The caster can attempt to
                    make other people invisible only if his spell rank is Amazing or better. If the individual is a
                    willing subject, then the caster must make a spell rank FEAT roll. If the individual is unwilling,
                    then the caster must make a spell rank FEAT roll with a -2CS penalty.

                    Anyone not used to being invisible will have a real problem moving about (movement halved),

                    requires at least 10 rounds of being invisible before becoming used to it.

                    This spell is used to give the caster an advantage in combat. It enables him to quickly learn from
                    his mistakes. After this spell is cast the caster must fight his opponent for three consecutive
                    rounds (normal combat, magical combat, astral combat, etc.). When the three rounds have passed the
                    caster suddenly has insight into his opponent’s methods of combat and receives a +1CS when fighting
                    that opponent during this encounter only. The duration and area of effect listed on the Magical
                    Limits Table do not apply for this spell.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If combat is interrupted but later resumed and the Judge is not sure whether to consider it one
                    continual encounter or two separate encounters, the spell still applies if the caster makes a
                    successful spell rank FEAT roll.

                <p>
                    This spell enables the caster to mystically rise into the air. A successful spell rank FEAT roll is
                    required. No further FEAT rolls are needed unless the caster descends to the ground, and then want
                    to levitate again during the duration of the spell. The maximum altitude a levitating character can
                    reach is 1 area at Good rank, with an additional 2 areas for every spell rank above Good (thus, a
                    caster with a Remarkable Levitation spell can reach an altitude of 5 areas). The movement speed
                    (rising or descending) per round is 1 area for a character with Good Psyche with an additional area
                    for each Psyche rank above Good. The character cannot use this spell to lift any weight greater than
                    his normal clothing and equipment. This spell affects the caster only.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The character can perform other actions while airborne, including combat, but is limited to one
                    spell per round regardless of the type of energy (personal, universal, or dimensional). If knocked
                    unconscious while levitated, a character will immediately fall to the ground.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This spell should not be mistaken for the ability to fly (see the Flight spell). Levitation only
                    allows vertical movement. Sideways movement is only achievable by the levitating character pulling
                    himself along an object. A levitating character cannot create forward momentum to affect the
                    direction of his ascent. It is always straight up. While wind has no affect on a floating caster’s
                    ascent direction, it can slow him down if the Judge feels it is strong enough.

                    The caster can link his mind with other, willing magic wielders, thus giving him additional power.
                    Up to four magic wielders can be linked in this manner. For every magic wielder linked to his mind,
                    the caster gains a +1CS to the spell rank of any spell he casts, up to a maximum of Shift X rank.
                    (Exception: this spell cannot increase the rank or effects of Link spells.) If the spell involves a
                    range factor, the range is increased to that of the shifted spell rank. If the spell inflicts
                    damage, the area of effect and the spell rank is shifted, for purposes of FEAT rolls, but damage is
                    increased by 10 points (not 1 rank) for each additional mind linked. (For example, if three magic
                    wielders are linked to a caster with an Incredible rank in Eldritch Crystals, he would receive a
                    +3CS for the area of effect and chance of a successful spell rank FEAT roll, but any damage caused
                    would be 70 points, not 100.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only the caster who initiates the Link spell can perform any actions. All other magic wielders who
                    are linked must remain in place and concentrate. If the caster they are linked to sustains damage,
                    they absorb one-tenth of that damage too, rounded down. The link also increases the caster’s Psyche
                    for resistance to mental attack. For every additional mind linked, apply a +1CS to the caster’s
                    Psyche when defending against mental attack.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The link is automatically broken if the caster is rendered unconscious or if he loses control of his
                    own mind (due to Confusion spells, Fear spells, Mental Control spells, etc.)

                    The caster can disrupt probability fields so that very unlikely events can occur, somewhat like
                    creating his own luck. For example, he could cause a table to collapse or a machine to tip over. He
                    can not cause something to happen if that event is impossible; tables can not be created from
                    nothing, and machines just can’t cease to exist. When the caster uses his spell, the player
                    describes exactly what effect is wanted, and the Judge decides whether or not that effect is within
                    the spell’s power and assigns an appropriate FEAT color. To use the spell the caster must make a
                    successful spell rank FEAT roll. If the caster is trying to alter probabilities around magic
                    materials or energies, such as magical artifacts or temples, apply a -2CS to the spell rank when
                    making the FEAT roll.

                    organic tissue and fabric are easily manipulated while “hard” inorganic materials require a
                    successful spell rank FEAT roll. No material can be manipulated if its Material Strength rank is
                    greater than the spell rank. The caster can easily manipulate the hair or clothing of another
                    character, causing them to constrict or bind the target (Strength for grappling would equal the
                    spell rank). If the caster is attempting to affect organic tissues or muscles in another creature,
                    the caster must make a successful Psyche FEAT roll. If successful, the victim must make an Endurance
                    FEAT roll or suffer damage equal to this spell rank. The spell can only be used on one target at a
                    time.

                    The caster can magically reshape inanimate objects in the same area that he occupies (ignore normal
                    area of effect). He cannot change the material rank of the object or increase or decrease the mass.

                <p>
                    (Examples of how to use this spell include: changing a hood’s pistol into a wrench; turning a wooden
                    door into a table; altering a bulletproof glass windshield into a large bulletproof glass salad
                    bowl; etc. The caster can only change objects whose Material Strength are equal to or less than his
                    spell rank. Once magically altered the item remains that way unless this spell is used again.

                    The Judge should start the caster with a size or mass limitation (“about the size of a bread box”)
                    and let him slowly build it up as he becomes more experienced.

                    This spell does not penetrate force fields of any type.

                    This spell creates a magical invisible headgear which does not hinder the caster’s normal senses. It
                    allows the caster to know when someone is trying to intrude on his thoughts, magically attack his
                    mind through mesmerism, illusion, etc. It does not indicate who is doing the attacking or intruding,
                    nor does it reveal what spell is being used.

                <p>
                    In the round following the one in which the hostile spell is detected, the caster can, secure the
                    barrier, preventing illusions, telepathy, empathy, etc., from affecting the caster. It also protects
                    him from magical attacks on the mind (Emotion Control, Confusion, Fear, Mental Control, etc.) by
                    giving him a +3CS for any Psyche FEAT roll to resist the attack. While the barrier is up the caster
                    can perform no spells that require/a great deal of concentration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Treat the spell rank as body armor for the sake of defense against attempted mental penetration by
                    non-magical powers.

                <p>
                    The Judge should make sure this spell is not abused. A character who constantly has the barrier up
                    will become easily exhausted and can even suffer Psyche loss due to the mind damaging effects of
                    trying to always be mentally protected. The maximum safe duration rank is Excellent.

                    The caster can magically attack another character’s mind and attempt to control it. The target must
                    be visible and the attacker’s spell rank-must be equal to or higher than the victim’s Psyche rank to
                    attempt the control. The caster must make a successful spell rank FEAT roll to control the target.
                    The victim is controlled until the attacker releases him or until the duration of effect is up,
                    whichever comes first. If the victim is ordered to do something he would normally be strongly
                    opposed to, such as hurting himself or a friend, turn himself in to the police (if he’s a villain),
                    etc. he is allowed a Psyche FEAT roll, and, if successful, breaks the mind control.

                    The caster creates a tiny, magical tendril that can probe another person’s mind. If the caster
                    succeeds in his spell rank FEAT roll, the probe will reveal the target’s true identity and details
                    concerning it. This spell should not be confused with Empathy, Mental Control, or other, stronger
                    spells. This spell does not allow the caster to manipulate the target’s mind.

                    This is a basic magical form of hypnotism that permits the caster to communicate with and command
                    specific creatures of less than human intelligence. To communicate with a creature requires a
                    successful Psyche FEAT roll. Commanding a creature is possible only if the caster’s spell rank is
                    greater than the creature’s Endurance rank, and also requires a successful spell rank FEAT roll.

                <p>
                    The target must be able to see the caster to be affected by this spell. If the caster is affected by
                    an attack in the round he casts this spell, the mesmerism is automatically broken.

                    When this spell is obtained, the caster will be able to mesmerize only one specific type of animal:
                    mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, insects, etc. As he becomes experienced he can learn how
                    to mesmerize other types (Judge’s discretion).

                    This spell operates in the same fashion as Mesmerism, but communication and command is between the
                    character and intelligent artificial life forms, such as robots and androids. The caster’s spell
                    rank must be higher than the mechanism’s Reason. A mechanism that has an organic brain, such as a
                    cyborg, receives a Psyche FEAT roll to resist this spell: if it is successful, the target is
                    unaffected.

                    The caster can manipulate one of the four elemental materials (fire, water, earth, air) or the
                    weather. In all cases, the spell rank functions as Strength. A caster with Incredible Strength can
                    lift 10 tons; a caster with Incredible earth control can use his spell to manipulate up to 10 tons
                    of mineral matter. The spell only affects existing elements within the area of effect; the caster
                    cannot create elements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any Nature Control spell can be used as an attack by forming columns of the elements which strike
                    the target; the damage caused equals the spell rank number. A caster can manipulate the appropriate
                    elements within the area of effect, but they must be within sight. Affecting anything further away
                    than five areas requires a successful yellow FEAT roll; a successful red FEAT roll is needed to
                    affect anything more than ten areas away.

                <p>
                    Only non-living, inanimate material can be manipulated. The player may pick the type of control his

                            By using this spell, the caster may create winds or a partial vacuum. Defensively, thrown
                            objects
                            and missile weapons are deflected (as if the caster was dodging) and all character’s in the

                            area as the caster are protected. Offensively., this spell creates a whirlwind that
                            functions as a
                            grappling attack. This spell can push objects around, using the spell rank as Strength.

                            This spell is a unique combination of all four elemental control spells. It allows the
                            caster to
                            manipulate the weather within his area of spell. Storms, rain, wind, and snow can be
                            summoned. The
                            temperature can be raised or lowered. Lightning bolts can be called down. Each weather
                            effect
                            requires a spell rank FEAT roll to succeed, and causes damage equal to the spell rank if
                            used to
                            attack someone. If the caster is knocked unconscious after controlling the weather, it will
                            return
                            to normal the following round, unless the caster is knocked unconscious during wildly
                            violent
                            weather (storm, tornado, blizzard, etc.), in which case the caster must make a spell rank
                            FEAT roll;
                            if successful, the violent weather abates, if unsuccessful, the weather goes wild.

                    The caster can weave an enchanted net from his magical energy. This net radiates from the caster in
                    all directions, and imprisons anyone within a one area range, whether it is friend or foe (ignore
                    the usual area of effect). The web is a physical manifestation that has a material rank equal to the
                    spell rank. It can be ripped or shredded, and will disappear if the caster is knocked unconscious.
                    The caster can move when radiating this net only if he makes a successful red Psyche FEAT roll; the
                    net disappears if he fails the roll. If he teleports out of the net, or in some other mystical way
                    leaves the net without physically moving it, the net will remain in place and intact for the
                    duration of effect.

                    This spell creates a magical tendril that attacks the target’s mind, making him unable to move. If
                    the caster’s spell rank FEAT roll is unsuccessful, the target will not even suspect he has been
                    attacked. It the caster’s spell rank FEAT roll is successful, the target is allowed a Psyche FEAT
                    roll to resist. If the target’s resistance roll is successful, he is unaffected but knows that he
                    has been attacked. If the target’s resistance roll is unsuccessful, he becomes completely paralyzed
                    for a number of rounds equal to the roll of one die, plus 2 additional rounds. A paralyzed character
                    cannot move or speak, but he can see, hear, smell, and use mental spells (it he has any). Only a
                    creature with a brain (including cyborgs) can be paralyzed. Medical treatment cannot cure magical
                    paralysis.

                    Plants can be used to attack (damage and Strength or Agility equals the plant’s Material Strength
                    +1CS, usually Typical or Good), as spies (the caster can verbally communicate with the controlled
                    plants) and a wide range of miscellaneous uses (as ladders, cushions, bindings, etc.).

                    A magic wielder of a Nature magic school using this spell shifts the plants’ attack abilities up
                    another +1CS, and can communicate through a chain of plants (for example, a tree talking to a field
                    of wheat, which asks a moss covered embankment what the caster wishes to know) as well as directly
                    with one plant.

                <p>
                    Note: Whenever communications wi!h plants occur two things must be kept in mind: plants are not too
                    bright and cannot identify things by sight but by feeling their size and weight as they pass by;
                    fields and other large groupings of small plants are considered as one entity.

                    The caster, by remaining immobile and concentrating fully, can look back in time, seeing a vision of
                    past events. The maximum area he can observe is his area of effect. He cannot be seen by those
                    shades of the past and he can hear no sound. This spell requires full concentration. A successful
                    spell rank FEAT roll is required.

                <p>
                    The range of time that may be traveled back is 3 months multiplied by the caster’s Psyche rank
                    number. For example, a character with an Amazing Psyche (50 points) can go back 150 months, or 12
                    years, 6 months. The vision starts at the far end of the time span and runs towards the present. If
                    the caster makes another successful FEAT roll he can “freeze” the vision, or replay an event already
                    shown. He cannot interfere in any way with time, only observe what has happened in the space he is
                    concentrating on.

                    rank of the Power Block. This does not work against any spell or power that has a rank exceeding the
                    caster’s Power Block spell rank. Technological powers, natural talents, and magic are not affected.
                    Dampened powers are returned to normal once the character is out of the caster’s area, but those
                    powers cannot enter the area and operate (for example, power beams that are fired into the caster’s
                    area will dissipate). Natural phenomena created outside of the area, such as a storm delivering
                    lightning bolts, will not affect the caster’s area.

            <p>
                The caster can duplicate one of the powers of a being possessing natural,
                non-magical super powers. The caster must touch the character to use the spell. If the other
                character is willing, the normal spell rank FEAT roll is not necessary. Only one power can be
                duplicated at any one time. The duplication of power does not remove the power from the target. The
                duration, area, and damage of the duplicated power is that of the caster’s spell rank, not the power
                rank of the original power.
            </p>
            <p>
                The caster can choose the power duplicated, if the caster knows the other character. If the
                character who is touched is relatively unknown to the caster, and the powers he possesses are not
                completely known, than the Judge should randomize what power the caster duplicates.
            </p>
            <p>
                The caster cannot duplicate magical spells, talents, artificial abilities (like Iron Man’s
                Strength), or extra limbs or other extreme physical differences (like Nightcrawler’s tail.)

                    The caster creates an invisible, magical headgear that completely surrounds the head without
                    hindering his senses. Four of the caster’s senses (sight, hearing, smell, and taste) are magically
                    protected against damage from attacks based on sensory overload (such as loud noise, blinding light,
                    or nauseating smells.) If the caster would normally make a FEAT roll to resist one of these sensory
                    attacks, use the spell rank of this spell if it is higher than the appropriate ability rank. If the
                    ability rank is higher, shift the ability rank one column to the right for the resistance FEAT roll.
                    If the attack normally succeeds automatically, the spell rank acts like body armor that protects the
                    senses.

                    The caster surrounds himself with an invisible aura that reflects non-magical energy attacks back to
                    the sender or device. Energy attacks with a power rank equal to or less than the spell rank
                    literally reflect off him and are directed, in full force, back at the attacker. Energy attacks of a
                    greater spell rank are reduced by one rank for the purposes of damage caused to the target. This has
                    no effect on mental or magical attacks.

                <p>

                    The spell counters the effects of other spells that preventing a character from acting or thinking
                    with complete control. Spells that can be countered by a Revival spell include Mesmerism, Emotion

                    rank FEAT roll is needed to break the spell. If the holding spell is a higher spell rank than the
                    Revival spell, then the caster must make a successful spell rank FEAT roll to break the spell
                    subtracting as many ranks from his spell’s normal spell rank as the holding spell exceeds it.

                    Table). The character can quickly scan the area of spell for conversation, unusual sounds, etc., but
                    the actual area listened to, within his range, cannot be larger than a 20 foot radius. When zeroed
                    in on, sounds from the area can be heard as if the caster was there himself. Any sound attack in the

                    for any unusual activities, but the actual area focused in on and viewed, within this range, may be
                    no larger than a 20 foot sphere. It is affected as sight normally would be by darkness, light

                    artifacts of evil design or exceptionally evil deeds. This spell is automatic (FEAT rolls are not
                    needed). As the caster gets closer to the source of the evil emanations, his sensing gets stronger.

                magicians casting spells, magical items that are being used or that have a protective spell cast on

                    The servant’s abilities are generated as for any other character. The Judge then gives it two
                    spells, and gives it an origin appropriate to the character it serves. Various types of magical
                    servants exist, including jinn, demons, familiars, ghosts, and the like. The servant is obedient,
                    helpful, and useful. The caster can automatically talk to or otherwise communicate with the servant.

                    disappears, though no damage reaches the caster during that round. Only one aura shield can surround
                    a character at any given time.

                    This shield protects an area. Unlike the other shields, the great shield is immobile and the caster
                    assigns it to a fixed position when he casts it. The size of the great shield can be anywhere from
                    the size of an individual shield up to a plane that is 1 area wide and 3 stories tall. It can be
                    located anywhere within the area of effect, but the caster must see the location to place it. The
                    great shield has an armor rank equal to the spell rank +2CS. It is usually transparent, but strange
                    runes can be seen scrawled around the edge. If it is struck by an attack with a higher power rank it
                    is shattered and disappears, though no damage penetrates it to harm the caster during that round.

                    The caster create a sorcerous shield to protect himself. The shield has an armor rank equal to the
                    spell rank. This shield is usually invisible to all but magic wielders and can be projected out away
                    from the caster’s outstretched hand a few feet. The caster moves the shield to block attacks. If the
                    caster is attacked from a number of sources at once the shield will only protect him from one
                    attack. If the caster is surprised, or if the attacking character succeeds in targeting a magical
                    beam or bolt as a bull’s-eye, it means the caster could not move his shield fast enough to deflect
                    the attack. If the shield is hit by an attack with a higher spell rank it shatters, though no damage
                    penetrates it to harm the caster during that round.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The caster can also use this spell to encircle himself with four weaker shields (armor rank
                    equalling the spell rank -1CS).
                </p>
                <p>
                    If any of the shields are broken, the remainder are unaffected. The caster cannot leave the circle
                    of shields until they dissipate or are destroyed.

                    This spell uses extradimensional energies to create a Multiple Shield. It is
                    identical to an Individual Shield, except that there are actually multiple shields behind the one
                    that appears. For every spell rank above Good, the caster has another Shield that immediately
                    appears when the previous shield has been shattered. For example, a caster with a Remarkable spell
                    rank has three Individual Shields, one right behind the other to protect him.

                    If the outermost shield is struck by an attack that is at least two ranks higher than the shield
                    rank, one or more inner shields are also broken; if the attack is 2 ranks higher, a second shield is
                    broken, at 3 ranks higher, a third shield, and so on. No damage will reach the caster in the round
                    the last shield is broken.

                    The caster can mystically shrink himself. The limit depends on his spell rank, and is listed on the
                    Magical Size Changes table, under the Growth spell. The caster’s Strength rank is unaffected by size
                    reduction, but he gets a +1CS when attacking, and opponents have a -2CS when they attack him. Damage
                    caused is as normal. Area effect attacks do not use these modifiers.

                    The caster has a magical spell that is almost identical to the Shrinking spell, but instead of being
                    able to shrink himself, he can shrink other characters and objects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the character to be shrunk is willing, then the caster must make a successful spell rank FEAT
                    roll to shrink him. The character will regain his normal height after the duration of spell or when
                    the caster wishes, whichever comes first.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the character to be shrunk is not willing, then not only does the caster have to make a spell
                    rank FEAT roll, but the target is allowed a Psyche FEAT roll to resist the effect (see the Magic
                    Effects Table). The target will return to his normal height after the duration of spell or when the
                    caster wishes, whichever comes first.

                <p>
                    If an object is to be shrunk, its material rank must be equal to or less than this spell rank. To
                    shrink an object, the caster must make a successful spell rank FEAT roll. The object will return to
                    its normal size only after the duration of effect has lapsed.

                    The caster can set up an invisible static field with his magical energy. This field, which blankets
                    his area of effect, disrupts television, radio, CB, walkie-talkie, and other broadcasting devices.
                    It also disrupts all closed-circuited monitoring security systems and scanners, most computer
                    systems, robotic “brains”, and any other highly sophisticated electronic devices. The field moves
                    with the caster and once an item is outside the field, it works as before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any attack that uses broadcast power, such as a maser (microwave), must punch through the field
                    first. Treat the spell rank as body armor for purposes of defense.

                    The caster can use his Universal or Dimensional energy to move objects within the area of effect. He
                    must see the object to initially move it, but once moving he can keep it moving if he loses sight of
                    it. However, if he drops an object he cannot see, he cannot lift it again. The spell rank determines
                    how much weight can be moved, as if it were Strength.

                <p>
                    This spell can be used to attack in two different ways. The caster can ensnare someone
                    telekinetically; the victim is considered grappled by a Strength equal to the spell rank, The caster
                    may also form a telekinetic fist and attack from a distance (but within the area of spell), making a
                    Psyche FEAT roll to hit his target. This will cause damage equal to the attacker’s Psyche rank.

                    The caster can direct his Universal or Dimensional energy broadcast his thoughts to others and to
                    read ‘ their thoughts. The person receiving the caster’s thoughts is not forced to respond. If
                    attempting to communicate with a being of a higher Psyche rank, the caster must make a successful
                    spell rank FEAT roll. While this spell is mainly communicative it is also a support spell which adds
                    a +1CS for any of the following spells used by the caster at the same time as he is using Telepathy:
                    Mental Probe, Mental Control, and Mesmerism.

                    Teleportation*. The caster can channel his Universal or Dimensional energy into a special type of
                    movement that allows him to travel instantaneously from one spot to another without physically
                    crossing any of the space between. The caster can teleport as far as his area of effect allows. If
                    the caster is familiar with the location he is teleporting to, or is able to see it, then he need
                    make no FEAT roll. If he is attempting to teleport into an unknown location he must make a spell
                    rank FEAT roll. A failed roll means he could not complete the movement and was “bumped” back to his
                    original point of departure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a caster tries teleporting into a solid object (because he is unaware of its presence) he must
                    make an Endurance FEAT roll; if this roll fails, he materializes outside the object but suffers
                    damage equal to the material rank of the object. The character is automatically slammed (1 area) and
                    may be stunned (make a FEAT roll for exact result).

                <p>
                    The visual effects that accompany teleporting (vapors rising, flash of light, slow fade out, etc.)

                    The caster mystically alters his senses so he can read, write, speak, and hear unknown language
                    spoken or written in his presence. The area of effect has no significance with this spell. If the
                    language is native to his world, no FEAT roll is needed. If the language is an alien one, he must
                    make a successful spell rank FEAT roll to be able to comprehend it.

                    The caster has two options with this spell, he can mystically slow down or speed up his metabolism.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The slowed metabolism reduces the potency of any poison in his body (-3CS). The character can almost
                    hibernate, thus lasting longer on fewer supplies in harsh climates, The character can feign death
                    and has a chance to fool even the best doctors into believing he has died; feigning death requires a
                    successful spell rank FEAT roll. While the caster’s body metabolism is slowed down, healing is also
                    slower (one-half his Endurance rank number per day).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The accelerated metabolism speeds up medicinal drugs injected into the caster’s system, thus
                    doubling the effects of healing. He can feign a fever, heart attack, and other maladies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the character has started his mystical trance he cannot move or do any action except
                    concentrate. He can come out of the trance whenever he desires, but it takes 2 rounds for his body
                    to return to full consciousness.

                    substance, retaining his own shape. There is a 15% chance that this spell is the type that can
                    transform the caster into any substance he wishes. Otherwise the caster must pick one of the
                    transformations listed below. In his altered form, the caster may assume the properties of that
                    material: water flows, energy travels at the speed of light, fire ignites flammable materials, and
                    so on. If the form is solid or sonic, the caster can use its material rank as body armor.

                    caster must make a spell rank FEAT roll. If he succeeds, the caster’s stored magical Universal or
                    Dimensional energy lashes out, causing damage to the attacker’s mind that is equal to the trap’s
                    spell rank. If he fails, the attack against the caster will be successful, but apply a -2CS to the
                    spell rank of the hostile spell.

                    The caster can conjure forth magical vapors, which pour out from around his feet, hands, or just
                    suddenly begin to swirl in the air (caster’s discretion). These vapors are thin and wispy and
                    constantly swirl around the caster’s body. During the duration of these vapors one of the caster’s
                    abilities is enhanced; the player picks the ability when the character obtains the spell-it can be
                    Agility, Strength, Endurance, or Psyche). The caster can then perform as normal without having to
                    concentrate on his enhancement. If the rank of this spell is higher than the caster’s normal
                    ability, use the spell rank. If the ability is higher than the spell rank, add one rank to the
                    ability when using this spell.

                    The caster can conjure forth magical vapors, which pour out from around his feet, hands, or just
                    suddenly begin to swirl in the air (caster’s discretion). The vapors resemble dense smoke of a color
                    specified by the caster. They fill the area he is occupying in one round. The caster can continue to
                    fill areas at a rate of one per round until some or all of his area of effect is full. These vapors
                    prevent anyone from seeing the caster, and even radar, sonar, and infrared devices cannot penetrate
                    them. The caster, on the other hand, can see through the vapors perfectly.

                <p>
                    The effect that the vapors have on combat is to provide the caster with a +1CS when striking an
                    opponent who is in the vapors and to penalize the opponent with a -2CS Shift for striking at the
                    caster, while the opponent is in the vapors.

                    clouds and will only cover the caster’s immediate area (if the spell rank is Good or less) or the
                    caster’s area and one adjacent area of his choice (if the spell rank is Excellent of better). The
                    vapors are not of sufficient density to affect anyone’s vision.

                    asleep for 1-10 rounds plus an additional 2 rounds. Loud noises, being nudged, and other “awakening”
                    conditions will arouse the characters affected. These vapors only last for one round, then
                    dissipate.

                    The caster can conjure forth magical vapors, which pour out from around his feet, hands, or just
                    suddenly begin to swirl in the air (caster’s discretion). These vapors will only cover one
                    individual the caster chooses within the area of spell. This character must be dying or dead for no
                    more than 2 rounds when the spell is cast. These extremely powerful vapors will bring the character
                    up to 0 Health points and keep him there (if he has died) or will freeze him at the level of his
                    current Health and Endurance. This “freezing” of the character will last for the duration of effect
                    and allows for time to treat his wounds or the condition which is killing him (taking him to a
                    hospital, applying spells that heal, etc.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once applied, these vapors wrap the target in a black, swirling shroud. The target remains
                    unconscious while in the vapors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The caster can dissipate the vapors at will. Once gone, by the caster’s will or at the end of the
                    duration of spell, the character starts dying and must follow the procedure on page 11 of the MARVEL
                    SUPER HEROES Game Battle Book.

                <p>
                    If the character the caster is trying to save has been dead for over 2 rounds, but less than 3
                    hours, the caster can try to create a special, potent vapor which will have the same effect as
                    described above. To create this special vapor requires the caster to make a spell rank FEAT roll and
                    deduct one rank from his Psyche (for a week) whether he succeeds in the spell or not. The caster can
                    keep attempting this spell, but must deduct the Psyche rank each time he tries. If his Psyche rank
                    drops to Feeble or below, due to the exercising of this spell, he permanently loses a Psyche rank.

                    The caster unleashes a sorcerous “wave” of mystical force causing damage equal to the spell rank.
                    The wave can be linear and directional or cover the complete area of spell, effecting everyone and
                    everything in its range. Whenever a wave of Remarkable intensity or higher ripples forth, all in the
                    area(s) must make an Agility FEAT roll to remain standing, otherwise they fall to the ground. The
                    duration of the wave is one round.

        <h3 id="how_spells_are_cast">How Spells Are Cast</h3>
        When a spell or magical power is used, there are four factors to consider: the rank of the spell or power;
        whether or not Psyche FEAT rolls are involved; column shifts due to special circumstances affecting the caster
        or target; the type of energy used.
        <h4 id="spell_rank">Spell Rank</h4>
        <p>
            As is explained in the Character Generation section, each spell or power has a spell rank assigned to it,
            rolled randomly when the spells are selected; random spell ranks range from Good to Amazing. Spell ranks are
            used in the same way as power ranks for non-magical powers. The spell rank of a spell, enchantment, etc., at
            the time it is used, dictates, if applicable, the duration of effect, area of effect, and damage potential
            of the spell. This information is given in the Magical Limits Table.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that as the spell ranks of the character’s individual spells increase, he becomes increasingly potent.
            A magic wielder with an Unearthly spell rank in certain spells can affect whole planets. A magic wielder
            with only a Good spell rank in the same spell may have difficulty casting it. In some cases a caster must be
            touching an object to cast a spell on it; if the object is very large, the area of effect is limited to the
            caster’s arm span.
        </p>
        <p>
            The original spell rank of any spell may be modified due to circumstances; see Target Column Shifts, below.
        </p>
        <p>
            A magic wielder can attempt to cast his spells at less than their maximum effect (see Voluntary Reductions
            in Spell Effects, in the MAGIC USE AND COMBAT section).

            Ranks of Typical or less are possible only due to negative column shifts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Spells and abilities below Class 1000 rank can be increased by column shifts to a maximum of Shift X. Spells
            and abilities less than Class 1000 rank cannot be increased to Class 1000 by column shifts regardless of the
            number of column shifts the caster or target receives. A negative column shift reduces Class 1000 spells and
            abilities to Unearthly, not Shift X.

        <h4 id="psyche_feat_rolls">Psyche FEAT Rolls.</h4>
        <p>
            Some spells used to attack or control another being allow the target a Psyche FEAT roll; in these cases, the
            target is unaffected if the FEAT roll is successful. This is only true for spells which use personal and

        <h4 id="differences_in_magical_energies">Differences in Magical Energies</h4>
        <h5 id="personal_spells_differences">Personal Spells</h5>
        <p>
            If a FEAT roll is required of the spell, any green, yellow, or red result indicates success. Personal energy
            spells, because they primarily affect the user, are usually “quiet” spells and enchantments, that is, no
            chanting or special gestures are required.
        </p>
        <h5 id="universal_spells_differences">Universal Spells</h5>
        <p>
            These spells, because they can affect others, sometimes allow for a Psyche FEAT roll by the target to reduce
            or ignore the affect of the spell. Universal energy spells draw on the ambient energy found in this
            universe, and a brief chant or gestures are sometimes used by the caster.
        </p>
        <h5 id="dimensional_spells_differences">Dimensional Spells</h5>
        <p>
            These spells are unique. They all draw the energy needed for the spell from another dimension and they
            require a special spell rank FEAT roll to tap the dimensional energy.
        </p>
        <h5 id="entreaty_spells_differences">Group Spells</h5>
        <p>
            These spells allow the caster to select from a collection of similar personal and universal energy
            spells; the spells available in each group spell are called “sub-spells.” Each day, a magic wielder must
            choose one sub-spell listed in his group spell; the one he chooses is the only sub-spell he can use from
            that group that day. A magic wielder is allowed to choose the same or a different sub-spell each day
            (note that the length of a “day” can be very different in other dimensions!).
        </p>
        <p>
            The spells within a group use the same definitions as the personal or universal spell of the same name,
            with three important differences: group spells use dimensional energy; a FEAT roll is only successful on
            a yellow or red result; the target of a group sub-spell is not allowed a defensive Psyche FEAT roll to
            avoid the effect, no matter what the normal personal or universal definition of the spell says.
        </p>
        <h5 id="entreaty_spells_differences">Entreaty Spells</h5>
        <p>
            These spells request an extra-dimensional being, artifact, or entity to allow its energy to be used by the
            caster for completion of his spell. These require the caster to call out the name of the being entreated,
            usually in some prosaic chant (the player does not have to do this aloud!). The Miscellany of Mysticism
            features a section on these entities, their intentions and inclination towards order or chaos, and some of
            the more famous entreaty spells associated with them.
        </p>
        <p>
            The player tells the Judge the desired effect of the entreaty spell and the Judge assigns a colored FEAT
            roll result that he feels is appropriate for success. The player must then make a FEAT roll that equals the
            assigned result in order to succeed. The Judge can use his discretion in assigning FEAT colors, but the
            following guidelines are suggested:

            * Assumes that the being entreated is friendly to the caster or his school. If the being is neutral,
            increase the FEAT result needed by one color (from Green to Yellow, for example). If the being is
            hostile to the caster, increase the FEAT result by two colors (from Green to Red, for example). An
            increase beyond Red is not possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            ** Assumes that the effect does not duplicate any group sub-spell that the caster has chosen for that
            day’s use (see Group Spells). If the effect duplicated would normally allow a Psyche FEAT roll to avoid
            its effect, the target is allowed the FEAT roll.
        </p>
        <p>
            If an entreaty FEAT roll is successful, the magic wielder has successfully tapped the dimensional
            energy. Usually, sorcerers will get best results by using dimensional energy from friendly sources-, but
            as explained in the Miscellany of Mysticism, some entities are neutral (not tending toward order or
            chaos), meaning that they can be called on at any time by any magic wielding character, despite his
            tendency towards order or chaos.
        </p>
        <p>
            A player might not always have to make a FEAT roll to use an entreaty spell. For every entreaty being a
            player rolls, the Judge should assign at least one spell connected with that being that the character
            can automatically use. However, this “automatic use” is allowed only for beings and spells that
            correspond to the character’s school of magic. If the first entreaty being rolled is hostile or neutral
            to the character’s school, the Judge should substitute a friendly being instead.
        </p>
        <h4 id="gaining_special_attention_from_extra-dimensional_beings">Gaining Special Attention From
            Extra-Dimensional Beings</h4>
        <p>
            Sorcerers often call upon extra-dimensional beings, dimensions, and sources of power to tap the energy
            needed to cast dimensional spells. Such entreaties are so common that extra-dimensional beings seldom
            investigate the identities and motives of the magic wielders who call upon them. However, the
            possibility of such investigation always exists if a magic wielder is calling upon a being not
            associated with his school of magic or if he is abusing the power of an otherwise friendly being. When
            an extra-dimensional being does take special notice of a sorcerer, it will almost always do so in order
            to put a presumptuous sorcerer in his place.
        </p>
        <h5 id="making_attention_checks">Making Attention Checks</h5>
        <p>
            Gaining the special attention of extra-dimensional beings is a problem usually faced only by Adept, Master,
            or Sorcerer Supreme level characters; Novices and Disciples are generally not powerful enough to provoke a
            hostile reaction from extra-dimensional beings. (See Book 2 for an explanation of these levels of mystic
            mastery.)
        </p>
        <p>
            When an Adept, Master, or Sorcerer Supreme successfully makes an entreaty to a being that is neutral or
            hostile to the sorcerer’s school of magic, the Judge must secretly make a FEAT roll on the Typical column;
            the character is not allowed to spend Karma to influence the Judge’s roll. If the being is neutral to the
            magic wielder’s school, the being will take notice on a Red FEAT roll. If the being is hostile to the
            caster’s school, the being will take notice on a Yellow or Red FEAT roll. The being will then either attack
            him, send him on a mission, restrict the further use of that spell, or just keep the character in mind for
            future reckoning (Judge’s discretion based on what the intent of the spell is, who is being called, how
            often the spell is used, if the character has been noticed before, etc.) Each time a magic wielder increases
            his spell rank in a neutral or hostile entreaty spell, the Judge should increase the rank for being noticed
            by the neutral or hostile being by one rank. (As can be seen, the more powerful a magic wielder becomes, the
            more dangerous it is for him to call upon neutral or hostile extra-dimensional beings.)
        </p>
        <h5 id="abusing_dimensional_entreaties">Abusing Dimensional Entreaties</h5>
        <p>
            If a magic wielder flagrantly abuses dimensional entreaties (by calling upon the same neutral or hostile
            being more than once per day, or more than five times in one week) the Judge can rule that the being’s
            reaction is automatically hostile (no FEAT roll needed). The same procedure can be used if a character
            abuses entreaties to a being usually friendly (such as a “good” sorcerer using entreaties to a good being to
            achieve evil goals.
        </p>
        <h5 id="codex_of_characters_and_creatures">Codex of Characters and Creatures.</h5>
        <p>
            When the Adepts, Masters, and Sorcerers Supreme listed in Book 3 make dimensional entreaties to neutral or
            hostile extra-dimensional beings, the Judge should make Typical FEAT rolls to see if the beings have hostile
            reactions. If a character increases an entreaty spell rank above that listed in Book 3, the Judge should
            increase the FEAT roll as usual.
        </p>
        <h4 id="countering_or_altering_spells">Countering or Altering Spells</h4>
        <p>
            Unless otherwise stated under the spell’s description, spells can usually be broken or altered by a magic
            wielding character who meets the following restrictions: the character attempting to break the spell must
            have knowledge of or access to the spell that he is attempting to break or alter (he cannot attempt to break
            a spell he has never or seldom experienced); the character attempting to break the spell must make a
            successful yellow Psyche FEAT roll. Also see the previous modifier section for modifying column shifts when
            attempting to counter or alter a spell.
        </p>
        <p>
            A character cannot counter a spell that uses energy unavailable to him (for example, a character who cannot
            use dimensional energies cannot attempt to counter a dimensional spell.

        <h5 id="number_of_personal_and_universal_spells_allowed_per_round">Personal and Universal Spells</h5>
        <p>
            A magic wielder can normally cast one personal or universal spell per round. However, at the beginning of
            the round, the magic wielder can announce that he will attempt to cast two spells that round. He then makes
            an Agility FEAT roll. If he obtains a Red result, he can successfully cast both spells. If the FEAT roll
            fails, he is limited to one spell that round, and a -1CS is applied to the spell rank (in his haste, he has
            garbled the spell slightly).
        </p>
        <p>
            If the sorcerer succeeds in his attempt to cast two spells in one round, he can cast two personal or two
            universal spells, or one of each type.
        </p>
        <p>
            A magic wielder cannot cast a dimensional spell in the same round that he casts a personal or universal
            spell.
        </p>
        <h5 id="number_of_dimensional_and_entreaty_spells_allowed_per_round">Dimensional and Entreaty Spells</h5>
        <p>
            A magic wielder can cast only one dimensional spell (including entreaty spells) per round, and cannot cast a
            personal or universal spell in the same round that he cast a dimensional spells.
        </p>
        <h5 id="number_of_group_spells_allowed_per_round">Group Spells</h5>
        <p>
            Group spells use dimensional energies, and only one group subspell can be cast per round.
        </p>
        <h4 id="distracting_situations">Distracting Situations</h4>
        <p>If conditions surrounding a spellcaster are extremely distracting, he must make a Psyche FEAT roll to get his
            spell off in one round. If he falls the FEAT roll, the spell will take two rounds to cast. Distracting
            conditions may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Caster has been affected by an opponent’s spell or attack this round.</li>
            <li>Caster’s friend or loved one is in danger of immediate death.</li>
            <li>An innocent bystander is in danger of immediate death (evil spellcasters are generally not distracted by
                this).</li>
            <li>Caster’s mind has been affected by travel in a sanity-bending or sanity-threatening dimension.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The Judge can define other events as distractions. Note that evil spellcasters often endanger bystanders or
            the loved ones of an opponent in order to gain time to escape or to put their opponent at a disadvantage.
            The Judge should not delay the spellcasting of heroes who are trying to rescue endangered heroes or
            innocents, but should delay the spellcasting of a hero who ignores the danger to others and continues the
            battle.
        </p>
        <h4 id="casting_shifts_and_modifications">Casting Shifts and Modifications</h4>
        <p>
            Previously discussed column shifts and modifications (a target’s Psyche difference and the distraction of
            the spellcaster being the two most important) are applicable in combat.
        </p>
        <h4 id="timing_of_spell_effects">Timing of Spell Effects</h4>
        <p>
            Spells drawing upon personal or universal energies go into effect during the magic wielder’s part of the
            round. Dimensional energy spells, because they require a few more seconds to tap into the dimensional energy
            flow, do not go into effect until the end of the round; however, the dimensional spell of a caster who won
            initiative goes into effect before the dimensional spell of a caster who lost initiative.
        </p>
        <h4 id="astral_combat">Astral Combat</h4>
        <p>
            A favorite tactic among sorcerers of “white” or “order” magic is astral combat. Astral combat occurs when
            the combatants are capable of Astral Projection and choose to enter the astral plane and use it as their
            battlefield. Magic works for a sorcerer while in astral form and astral combat can be devastating for the
            combatants while not affecting anything in the physical plane (the “real world”); however, a character who
            is in astral form can still control his magical items (if any) on the physical plane.
        </p>
        <p>
            Astral combat cannot be seen, heard, or felt by those not in the astral plane, so no one in the real world
            even knows combat is happening (which is. why the “white” sorcerers prefer it, to save lives and reduce
            damage).
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Note:</i> The rule on astral combat not affecting the physical plane is true for the Earth dimension, but
            does not always apply to other dimensions. Some dimensions are so structured as to allow spells from the
            astral plane to enter and affect the physical plane.
        </p>
        <p>
            Magic wielders are usually less powerful when in the astral plane than when in the physical plane. Apply a
            -1CS to the spell rank of any spell cast by a magic wielder in the astral plane.
        </p>
        <p>
            A character cannot use his Astral projection spell to force an unwilling opponent to enter the astral plane
            for astral combat.
        </p>
        <h4 id="voluntary_reductions_in_spell_effects">Voluntary Reductions in Spell Effects</h4>
        <p>
            A character usually casts spells at full power– the maximum rank available for the spell. However, a magic
            wielder can attempt to “pull his punch”, that is, reduce the effect of a spell he casts. If a magic wielder
            wants to reduce the effect of an attack or other spell, the player must first make the usual FEAT roll for
            success (if a FEAT roll is required), then make a separate spell rank FEAT roll to reduce the effect. If the
            reduction FEAT roll succeeds, any or all of the effects associated with the spell (duration of effect, area
            of effect, damage) can be reduced. A caster can reduce some of the associated effects, while leaving others
            at maximum. The caster can also reduce the color of the result on the Universal table by one color (from red
            to yellow or from yellow to green). A failed reduction FEAT roll means that the effort to control the spell
            failed and the spell was cast at maximum rank.

            Magical combat is somewhat different from other forms of combat. In magical combat, strength of mind and
            willpower are the key to victory, and physical combat between magic wielders is rare. The Magic Effects
            Table included here reflects those differences. It includes new results that are special to magical combat
            and also replaces some of the effects shown on the <a href="/system/universal_table.html">Universal
                Table</a>.
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Bite-Claw</dt>
            <dd>This replaces the Hack & Slash column of the <a href="/system/universal_table.html">Universal Table</a>.
                This
                column is used for attacks by
                extradimensional creatures and monsters, by animals, and by any character attacking with a sharp weapon,
                such as a sword or knife. Note that “Kill” results are not possible on this column.</dd>
            <dt>Targeting</dt>
            <dd>This replaces the Shooting & Throwing column of the <a href="/system/universal_table.html">Universal
                    Table</a>. It is used when a magic
                wielder wants to try for a Bull’s-Eye effect, like shooting a magical wand out of an opponent’s hand or
                avoiding an opponent’s Individual Shield spell. This column is also used for all thrown weapons and all
                missile weapons except those that fire some kind of energy blast.</dd>
            <dt>Blasting</dt>
            <dd>This column is used for most common forms of attack spells, such as Eldritch Beams/Bolts, and for
                magical energy weapons as well. This column also applies to attacks by non-magical energy weapons, such
                as the blasters in Doctor Doom’s armor (the Doctor can be found in Book 3). The title “POWER RANK” used
                here refer to the “ability” being used, that is, the spell rank of an attack spell, or the power rank of
                a magical or non-magical energy weapon.</dd>
            <dt>Mental Control</dt>
            <dd>This column is used for any spell that attempts to seize control of the target’s mind.</dd>

            <dd>(See the explanation of results section.)</dd>
            <dt>FEAT Roll</dt>
            <dd>This column is used for any spell that allows the target to avoid the effect by making a successful
                Psyche FEAT roll (except “mental control”type spells, which use the “Hold?” column).</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
            Dodging attempts, charge attacks and FEATs based upon Strength ability use the appropriate column from the

        </p>
        <p>
            Following is the explanations for each result:
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Miss</dt>
            <dd>The attacker did not succeed. He can usually try again in the next round.</dd>
            <dt>Hit</dt>
            <dd>The target is struck. The target loses Health points if the attack was damaging.</dd>
            <dt>Slam</dt>
            <dd>In addition to receiving the damage of the attack (as a Hit), the target may be slammed if the
                attacker’s Strength or the spell rank of his attack, whichever applies, is equal to or higher than the
                target’s Endurance rank; the target must make an Endurance FEAT roll and consult the “Slam?” column on
                the Magic Effects Table.</dd>
            <dt>Stun</dt>
            <dd>In addition to receiving the damage of the attack (as a Hit), the target may be stunned if the
                attacker’s Strength or the spell rank of his attack, whichever applies, is equal to or higher than the
                target’s Endurance rank; the target must make an Endurance FEAT roll and consult the “Stun?” column on
                the Magic Effects Table.</dd>
            <dt>Bull’s-Eye</dt>
            <dd>The attacker hits the target wherever he wants. There are some limits on this: first, the attacker
                cannot kill or maim a living target by hitting him in a vital area, like the heart or head. (There are
                no killing shots in the Magic Effects Table.) The attacker can temporarily disable the target by hitting
                him in the arm or leg. He can also knock an object out of somebody’s hand, or even hit a lever or button
                on a machine. In any case, the attacker must say he is trying for a bull’s-eye (and say what he is
                trying to hit) before rolling the dice. Otherwise, this is just a normal hit.</dd>
            <dt>Hold</dt>
            <dd>The attacker’s magical control is taking hold. The target must make a Psyche FEAT roll and consult the
                “Hold?” column of the Magic Effects Table.</dd>
            <dt>Escape</dt>
            <dd>The target has managed to escape the attacker’s magical control. The target remembers that he has been
                attacked.</dd>
            <dt>Reverse</dt>
            <dd>The target has not only escaped the attacker’s magical control but, if the target’s Psyche rank is
                greater than the attacker’s, the target has seized control of the attacker’s mind. If the target has a
                Psyche equal to or less than the attacker, treat this result as an Escape.</dd>
            <dt>Affected</dt>
            <dd>The target is unsuccessful in his attempt to avoid the effect of the attacker’s spell.</dd>
            <dt>Not Affected</dt>
            <dd>The target has avoided the effects of the attacker’s spell.</dd>
            <dt>1 Area</dt>
            <dd>In addition to the magical attack doing its normal damage, the target gets knocked right out of his area
                into an adjacent one. The attacker picks the area. The two areas must be next to each other. If there is
                an obstacle between the two areas the spell rank of the attack must be checked. If it is stronger than
                the material strength of the obstacle, the magic attack and target go through it. Otherwise, the target
                bounces off. In either case, the slammed target loses additional Health points, equal to the amount he
                received from the hit.</dd>
            <dt>Same Area</dt>
            <dd>In addition to the magical attack doing its normal damage, the target gets knocked down in the same
                area. Getting up will require a full round, during which he can do nothing else.</dd>
            <dt>1-10 Rounds</dt>
            <dd>The target loses all of his Health points and passes out. The Judge rolls one die to see how many rounds
                the target will be unconscious. When he awakens he recovers as many Health points as his Endurance rank
                number. He does not make an Endurance FEAT roll to see if he starts losing Endurance ranks.</dd>

                    learn spells on his own (spells that he has read in a tome or on a scroll must be studied each time

                    Novices are usually ignored by the more powerful dimensional entities. A novice using a Dimensional
                    Entreaty spell uses his magic as normal, but no FEAT roll is necessary to determine if the entity
                    entreated will be affronted by the entreaty and take action. The dimensional entity feels that it is
                    an investment in the future, but the character is currently beneath his total consideration. A
                    novice can, however, provoke a hostile reaction from extradimensional entities by abusing their
                    power—using it in ways the entity would not normally approve of (see “Abusing Dimensional

                    using a Dimensional Entreaty spell uses his magic as normal, but no FEAT roll is necessary to
                    determine if the entity entreated will be affronted by the entreaty and take action. The dimensional
                    entity feels that it is an investment in the future, but the character is currently beneath his

                    rank of at least Remarkable in all of them and Amazing or higher in at least five. A sorcerer
                    supreme has the greatest amount of mystical knowledge in his dimension.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A sorcerer supreme spends all of his time guarding his dimension, teaching any students he may have,
                    and studying mystical lore.

                <p>
                    A sorcerer supreme is more recognizable for his worthiness than for the power he wields. He earns
                    his rank through vigilance against foes and by overcoming the constant burden of responsibility this
                    rank involves.

                “Many times I have sat thus and read my master’s writings. and each time I am filled with greater awe of
                the Ancient One’s sensitivity and knowledge. There is much even a master of the ancient arts can
                acquire from the Learned One’s teachings.“ — Doctor Strange
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                This observation by the good Doctor adds further definition to how a spell is controlled. If a spell
                were to be directly manipulated by the character, such as the Human Torch, it is because the character
                has had an accident which physically altered him to control that spell, or the character is a mutant and
                was born with the ability to control that spell. Magic is different. It is the knowledge of how to tap
                into that spell and manipulate it. And how does one gain that knowledge? Through learning the ancient
                arts with a master!
            </p>
        </aside>
        <p>
            The importance of a master for a magic wielding character cannot be overstated. It is the best and often
            only way the hero can progress in his knowledge of magic use. This includes learning new spells.
        </p>
        <p>
            The “KARMA AND ADVANCEMENT” section of Book 1 lists the Karma costs involved in improving spell ranks and
            learning new spells. As can be seen, characters who so not have masters pay a heavy penalty. Some
            characters (especially those of the Eclectic school) learn a trick or two through the studying of tomes,
            but to gain skill in magic a character must be taught by a master.
        </p>
        <p>
            Systematic studying with a master has additional benefits as well:
        </p>
        <h4 id="disciple_benefits">Disciples</h4>
        <p>
            The disciple can learn one spell from a written tome or scroll every nine months of game time, provided the
            disciple is taking sufficient time to study it (usually about half his time, assuming that he studies
            daily). If the disciple goes more than a week without study, the spell cannot be learned. The normal
            amount of Karma points needed to gain this spell is waived by the Judge, as an extensive amount of time is
            being committed to the studies that could otherwise be spent in gaining Karma.
        </p>
        <p>
            A player can request that his character be allowed to study a particular spell, but the Judge makes a final
            decision on spell availability.
        </p>
        <p>
            The beginning spell rank for a spell learned in this way is Good.
        </p>
        <h4 id="adept_benefits">Adepts</h4>
        <p>
            The adept can learn one spell from a written tome or scroll every six months of game time, provided the
            adept is taking sufficient time to study it (usually about half his time, assuming that he studies daily).
            If the adept goes more than a week without study, the spell cannot be learned. The normal amount of Karma
            points needed to gain this spell is waived by the Judge, as an extensive amount of time is being committed
            to the studies that could otherwise be spent in gaining Karma.

        <p>
            A player can request that his ‘ character be allowed to study a particular spell, but the Judge makes a
            final decision on spell availability.
        </p>
        <p>
            The beginning spell rank for a spell learned in this way is Good.
        </p>
        <h4 id="master_benefits">Masters and Sorcerers Supreme</h4>
        <p>
            A master of the mystic arts can learn one written spell in a tome or scroll every five months of game time,
            provided the character is taking sufficient time to study it (usually about half his time, assuming that
            he studies daily). If the master goes more than two weeks without study, the spell cannot be learned. It
            must be remembered, though, that the time spent adventuring is much greater and the time for study will
            exclude other duties or appearances. This completely halts any Karma or Popularity increase by any means
            other than that directly related to an adventure.
        </p>
        <p>
            The normal amount of Karma points needed to gain this spell is waived by the Judge, as an extensive amount
            of time is being committed to the studies that could otherwise be spent in gaining Karma.
        </p>
        <p>
            A player can request that his character be allowed to study a particular spell, but the Judge makes a final
            decision on spell availability.
        </p>
        <p>
            The type of spells available that can be learned and their energy types are at the Judge’s discretion. The
            beginning spell rank for a spell learned in this way is Excellent.
        </p>
        <h4 id="masters_and_students">Masters and Students</h4>
        <p>
            A master can find and teach one student, if he desires. The time it takes to train a student is great, so a
            master may not learn new spells from tomes or scrolls while teaching his student.
        </p>
        <p>
            The student starts out at novice level with only one spell. (Roll the student and his spell up randomly).
            For every two hundred hours the master spends with the novice, the student can learn one personal spell
            at a Good spell rank. For every three hundred hours the master spends with the novice, the student can learn
            one universal spell at a Good spell rank. (The student is limited to learning one spell at a time, so
            learning a personal and a universal spell would take 500 hours of instruction.)
        </p>
        <p>
            The player may play the student as he does his normal character, even taking him on adventures, but two
            considerations must be kept in mind: the novice is not considered to be studying for his spells when he is
            adventuring, whether he is accompanying the master or not; a master who loses a novice, whether to death or
            to an enemy, suffers a penalty of Karma loss (half of his current Karma vanishes) and he cannot take on a
            new student for at least a year of game time.
