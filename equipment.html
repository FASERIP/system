        <p>
            Most but not all heroes have "natural," inborn Powers, or weapons that exist as a part of their outfit.
            However, as most of the hero's opponents are armed with devices such as those found below, a more-than-
            passing knowledge of the common types of weapons and what they can do will aid the hero's survival.
        </p>
        <p>
            These table list all the common, readily available weapons and related material used by criminals.
            subversive societies, law enforcement agencies, and the military. Specialized weapons may be created by
            invention or modification.
        </p>
        <h4 id="shooting_weapons">Shooting Weapons</h4>
        <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
        <p>
            Shooting Weapons is the general term for all forms of handguns, rifles, bows, blasters, and missile or
            energy firing weapons, and range from handguns to battleship armament.
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt id="weapons_price">Price</dt>
            <dd>Price indicates the Resource rank of the weapons, from Poor to Unearthly. This Resource rank reflects
                the price if the item is available at all (lasers cannot be picked up at the local pawnshop). Items that
                are gained through criminal contacts (on the black market) are +1CS in cost (a Concussion Pistol,
                acquired through the black market, has an Amazing Resource rank rather than the listed value of
                Incredible).</dd>
            <dt id="weapons_range">Range</dt>
            <dd>Range is the maximum range of the weapon in question. For each area beyond the first, the weapon
                receives a -1CS to hit. This is different from ranged Powers, in which Range is set as effective number
                of areas. Example: a Thug with a rifle fires at a target five areas away with Excellent ability. The
                thug receives a - 4CS to hit as a result of the range. if the thug were striking with a Power (including
                such specialty items as a repulsor blast), then there would be no penalty to hit from range.</dd>
            <dt id="weapons_damage">Damage</dt>
            <dd>Damage lists the reduction of Health using standard damage. Stun weapons have special effects for
                damage, as they project a listed Intensity of Stunning force.</dd>
            <dt id="weapons_type">Type</dt>
            <dd>Type indicates the Results column used. Most of these weapons use the Shooting column, but lasers use
                the Energy column and Concussion weapons use the Force column.</dd>
            <dt id="weapons_rate">Rate</dt>
            <dd>Rate is the number of shots that may be fired per round. Multiple shots require separate die rolls, but
                are taken at the same time in the combat phase. Certain weapons fire bursts, which affect up to three
                adjacent targets, with one roll made for all targets. Some weapons are noted to scatter, which indicates
                all targets within one area of the target will be hit for that damage.</dd>
            <dt id="weapons_shot">Shot</dt>
            <dd>Shot indicates the number of shots the weapon can fire before it must be reloaded. That takes one round,
                though certain talents. such as Sow skill, may negate this.</dd>
            <dt id="weapons_material_strength">Material Strength</dt>
            <dd>Material indicates the material strength of the item. Scientific weaponry such as lasers tends to be
                more fragile and more expensive than the low-tech equivalents, and as such is not used by the man on the
                street.</dd>

            <dd>The Cheap Handgun is the weapon of choice of most low-level criminals. It is easy to use,
                sufficiently
                deadly, and most of all, inexpensive. The hero breaking up a liquor store robbery would most likely
                encounter this type of weapon. The cheap handgun takes only standard ammunition.</dd>
            <dt id="handgun_pistol">Handgun/Pistol</dt>
            <dd>The Handgun/Pistol is the next most common weapon, and like the cheap handgun, is easily concealed.
                A
                number of makes and models exist, noted by the different number of shots available. When the number
                is
                not predetermined (the text states a 9-shot pistol), assume the chambers hold 6 shots.</dd>
            <dt id="target_pistol">Target Pistol</dt>
            <dd>The Target Pistol is the most finely balanced and accurate of the pistols. The user of a target
                pistol
                suffers no penalty for range when firing with two hands. Its drawback is that the target pistol
                fires
                one shot, then must be reloaded.</dd>
            <dt id="variable_pistol">Variable Pistol</dt>
            <dd>The Variable Pistol has an advantage in that it may be set in the field to a specific type of
                ammunition
                and changed according to need. Most handguns fire standard ammunition and must be modified to fire
                other

            <dt id="automatic_rifle">Automatic Rifle</dt>
            <dd>The Automatic Rifle is a military weapon that fires bursts. A Semi-Automatic version with similar

                may be altered to fire normal shots. Possession outside of government-recognized agencies is illegal
                (Other Crime).</dd>
            <dt id="shotgun">Shotgun</dt>
            <dd>The Shotgun is a one- or two-barreled weapon that fires bursts. It is often loaded with non-lethal

                the
                area. The fire burns for Incredible (40) points damage the first round and continues to burn for 10

            <dt id="bazooka">Bazooka</dt>

        <h4 id="melee_and_thrown_weapons">Melee and Thrown Weapons</h4>
        <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
        <p>
            The common melee weapons listed on the table are listed according to Cost rank, normal (minimum) damage,
            type of damage (Edged Attack (EA), Edged Throwing , Blunt Attack (BA), Blunt Throwing , Grappling (Gp) or
            Grabbing (Gb)), and normal material strength.
        </p>
        <p>
            When attacking with an object in a Blunt Attack, the hero inflicts damage equal to his Strength or the
            material strength of the item, whichever is less. When attacking with a weapon designed for combat, the
            character will always inflict damage of the effects type listed and always a minimum of the damage listed (a
            knife will always inflict at least 10 points). A powerful character may inflict up to his Strength or the
            material strength of the object in damage, whichever is less. Example: Wonder Man with his bare hands can
            inflict up to 100 points of damage in slugfest. With a normal knife he can inflict a minimum of 10 points
            Edged Attack, and a maximum of 20 points (Excellent material) damage. That is why Wondy doesn't carry a
            knife.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Note:</i> If a weapon hits a material of higher material strength (knife against the Hulk's skin), there
            is a chance of it breaking as if purposely attempting to break the weapon. Make a Breaking FEAT roll,
            comparing the material strength of the object and either the Strength of the wielder or the material
            strength or Body Armor of the target. Example: Black Knight attacks Hulk with a regular sword (his Ebony
            Blade is being polished). Sword is Excellent material, Hulk's Body Armor is Monstrous, and Black Knight's
            Strength is Good. The attack inflicts no damage, and a second check is made, Good Strength breaking an
            Excellent material sword, to see if the blade breaks.

            Missiles are expensive propositions. In addition to a missile launcher, the user must purchase the missile
            itself, the specific payload to be used, and the control system This restricts missiles to those who can
            afford or invent them.

            A missile without a control device will fly in a straight line to its target's location at the time of the
            firing, and hit those in that area on the Shift 0 column (individuals who are not choosy about their targets
            often do this while loading up on the explosives). Aircraft Bombs (like the type in old 8-52 movies) an
            missiles without control devices (the "launcher" is in the plane itself -they are "launched" straight down).

            Not all characters have their own garage filled with neat vehicles, but most come into contact with this
            necessary type of equipment in some way (as weapons if nothing else). The table on pages 48-49 lists the
            more common and well-known craft in use.
        </p>
        <p>
            Vehicles are defined by six statistics: Type, Cost, Control, Speed, Body, and Protection.
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt id="vehicle_type">Type</dt>
            <dd>
                The Type of a vehicle is a handy definition of the general purpose. A Blimp, the Concorde, and the
                Avengers Quinjet are all basically airborne craft, and so are classified as "air" types. Vehicles of the
                same Type are normally bound by the same general rules regarding control and damage.
                <dl>
                    <dt id="vehicle_type_road">Road</dt>
                    <dd>Road vehicles are those designed primarily to be driven on relatively flat surfaces (like
                        roads), and include most vehicles found in modern cities. Road vehicles suffer penalties for
                        Control and Speed when off- road (like cutting through the park in your luxury lime).</dd>
                    <dt id="vehicle_type_off-road">Off-Road</dt>
                    <dd>Off-Road vehicles are land vehicles designed to handle broken ground better than road vehicles.
                        Some recreational vehicles and military equipment fall under this category.</dd>
                    <dt id="vehicle_type_railed">Railed</dt>
                    <dd>Railed vehicles follow a predetermined path or track; the most common example is Trains. A
                        Railed vehicle that runs off the track has disastrous effects.</dd>
                    <dt id="vehicle_type_gev">GEV</dt>
                    <dd>GEV means Ground Effect Vehicle, which is basically the hovercraft. GEVs exhibit properties of
                        both Air and Off-Road Vehicles, and as such deserve their own entry</dd>

                    <dt id="vehicle_type_space">Space</dt>
                    <dd>Space vehicles are those which are capable of sustained space travel in orbit or between

                    <dt id="vehicle_type_water">Water</dt>
                    <dd>Water vehicles are boats of every description. from sailboats to carriers. Their main limitation
                        is the danger of sinking. Submersible vehicles are those designed to travel underwater, and are
                        represented by the submarine. Subs are similar to water vehicles in the danger of sinking.</dd>
                </dl>
            </dd>
            <dt id="vehicle_cost">Cost</dt>
            <dd>The Cost of a vehicle is represented in the Cost column. It is often possible to buy a used (and
                therefore unreliable) version for one less than listed (a used sedan costs Excellent rather than
                Remarkable, and small countries can get their own used battleships for Monstrous cost).</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>The other four "Statistics" of a vehicle determine how well the vehicle performs under most situations.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt id="vehicle_control">Control</dt>
            <dd>The Control stat is a measure of how well the vehicle responds to moving in different directions and

            <dt id="vehicle_speed">Speed</dt>
            <dd>Speed is a note of the maximum safe speed of the vehicle.</dd>
            <dt id="vehicle_body">Body</dt>
            <dd>Body is the amount of damage the vehicle can sustain before a chance exists of system failure (the

            <dt id="vehicle_protection">Protection</dt>
            <dd>Protection represents the amount of equivalent Body Armor the vehicle provides for those within.</dd>

                from city to city at high speeds. The forward Tractor can be detached from the Trailer and has stats
                similar to the van. The rear trailer may be of a number of types, either to haul produce, mask
                secret
                operations, or carry equipment. The Tractor portion seats about 3 comfortably. Sleeper tractors can
                hold
                a king-size bed in the compartment behind the driver and thus can carry considerably more people.

            <dd>Description: A Rocket Car is the fastest land vehicle in the world and is only used in large areas
                where
                there is not much to hit, like the Bonneville Salt Flats. As a road vehicle, it is fairly useless
                due to

                guns
                as standard equipment. There are modified versions available, including those mounted with Laser
                Cannons, Stun Cannons, or Concussion Cannons instead of Light Artillery and carrying lasers instead

            <dt id="walker">Walker</dt>
            <dd>Description: The Walker is a curious form of off-road vehicle in that it does not have wheels or
                treads
                but rather two or more legs that simulate human or animal movement. Such devices are generally
                experimental and are used by organizations such as Hulkbusters. They are normally equipped with a
                stun
                cannon, as firing weapons with recoil (such as LAW or Light Artillery) would require a Control FEAT
                to
                prevent tipping over. Any attack on a walker vehicle requires a Control FEAT by the operator to

            <dt id="borer">Borer</dt>
            <dd>Description: The Borer is not really a land vehicle but a subterranean vehicle. It allows speedy

                through the underground. If moving at Poor speed, its passage leaves a tunnel that others may
                follow;
                otherwise, it leaves churned earth behind it. Villains who live deep within the Earth, such as Mole
                Man,
                use the Borer as standard equipment. Because of its construction, with the forward screw, the borer

            <dt id="train">Train</dt>
            <dd>The Train is the most common form of the Railed vehicles. All Railed vehicles cannot change their
                direction other than forward and backward, and may only change Speed. Control FEATs only concern
                sudden
                deceleration. If the track is removed or destroyed, the vehicle will immediately go out of control
                without chance of regaining control. Trains may be bulk carriers or passenger lines, such as Amtrak.
                The
                train maintains a "crew" of 5, and in the case of passenger trains, 3 or more cars that may each

                susceptible to winds. Blimps may take off vertically or horizontally. Early airships used explosive
                hydrogen for lifting (Amazing explosion), but helium is universally used today. If the Body of the

            <dt id="hydrofoil">Hydrofoil</dt>
            <dd>The Hydrofoil is among the fastest of watercraft. It attains its high speed by rising above the
                water on
                skis, reducing the drag from the boat in the water. The disadvantage is that any successful attack
                on
                the hydrofoil results in a Control FEAT to see if control is lost. If control is lost on a Hydrofoil

                navy,
                replaced by the carrier. There will be 2-4 super heavy artillery pieces, 4-6 heavy artillery on the

            <dd>
                <p>The building is the frame into which all the headquarters equipment is placed. It should have
                    enough
                    space for all equipment, plus extra space for the inhabitants and living quarters if required.
                    Let
                    common sense decide if the territory is getting too crowded for the members, rather than any set
                    rules. Heroes tend to be pack rats, acquiring bits and pieces from previous adventures,
                    interesting
                    technologies and half-finished experiments and mementos from old ex-foes. Were it not for
                    villains
                    scheming to destroy the HQs, heroes would have to hold garage sales in order to clear the
                    equipment
                    out.</p>
                <p>An easy way to determine if the building has sufficient room is to take an inventory of what is
                    inside. List the rooms and the major equipments therein (no, don't bother about hairbrushes and
                    the
                    like). This gives your heroes the idea of where to find that cosmic ray-blaster when the
                    Super-Skrull drops in unexpectedly.</p>
                <p>Heroes seeking an HQ may rent an existing structure, buy an existing structure, or build their
                    own.
                    The FF have done all 3, starting out renting the top 5 floors of the Baxter Building, then
                    buying
                    the structure outright, and most recently building a new Baxter Building after the original was
                    destroyed. Building your own HQ costs as much as buying, though the time must be figured using
                    the
                    building rules.</p>
                <p>Buildings are defined by a number of factors: original purpose, number of floors, running water
                    and
                    power, how close it is to schools, etc. While all these are important, the key is size, cost,
                    and
                    material strength of the structure. These are noted on this table.</p>

                    <li>Mid-sized housing is suitable for 2 or 3 heroes, any support crowd (offices would fit into
                        this
                        area), and runs no more than 5 areas or rooms.</li>
                    <li>Large is suitable for a number of heroes and equipment, and has 10 or more areas spread over
                        2
                        floors.</li>
                    <li>Deluxe is the largest size, and is for heroes with several vehicle types, trophy rooms, and
                        living quarters. It has 20 + areas spread through 3 or more floors.</li>
                </ul>
                Spider-Man's lodgings are an example of Small dwelling. The Heroes for Hire offices were Mid-sized,

            <dd>
                Cost is a reflection of location as well as sire of the structure. The listed prices are for a
                building
                in most American cities and their suburban surroundings. If the heroes are apartment hunting in
                Manhattan or the richer suburbs, the price is +1CS. If the heroes settle down in a relatively
                secluded
                spot, like Colorado, Tamarind Island, or Lake Geneva, the price is -1CS. Cost is presented in 2
                values.
                The first is the cost if the character is renting, payable by the month. The second is if the
                character
                is buying or building (in the case of apartments, this is dealing in condos).

            <dt id="building_material_strength">Material Strength</dt>
            <dd>
                Material strength is considered to be the strength of the walls and floors. For the sake of
                simplicity,
                wall and floor strength are noted as one and the same, but there will be situations where they may
                be
                different: in particular, dealing with large pieces of equipment. A floor can support a load equal
                to
                its material strength +2CS over time, and a higher amount for temporary periods (people walking on
                it).
                Material strength is considered similar through-out, though light-weight openings (windows, doors)
                will
                create weak spots that a hero (or villain) can crash through.

        <p>Once you have the building itself, you need to stock it with the various requirements for civilized life.
            Rather than sending would-be super-hero teams to various furnishing stores to price materials, we have
            organized the standard rooms found in most HQs and reduced them to "packages." The hero or team may pick
            up
            a standard package or modify what is available to suit their needs.</p>
        <p>Each package lists its cost, the amount of space (either in rooms or areas) it would take up, and what is
            found in that package. Packages are used to set up housekeeping and also for replacements in case of
            fire,
            flood, and Galactus dropping in for dinner.</p>
        <p>Costs are for a fairly nice selection of material. The heroes may acquire something less expensive and/or
            reliable (in the case of a living room, the furniture doesn't match— in the case of a second-hand danger
            room, it goes berserk more often than usual), at -1CS of price. Very high-quality packages (a Library
            Package stocked with first editions) may be +1CS or +2CS. Equipment may also be picked up by pieces, and
            for
            certain types of equipment, this is the only way of acquiring it.</p>
        <p>Rented, furnished places often have their own packages installed. This is included in the rent, though
            the
            hero is responsible for their replacement in case of damage or theft. ("Let me get this straight, Mr.
            Grimm.
            You threw a what through the where to hit who?")</p>
