            Characters in the MARVEL SUPER HEROES game are defined by their abilities. These abilities determine their
            chances of performing certain actions in the game. There are three types of abilities: primary, secondary,
            and special. Abilities are usually given a rank and rank number to define their levels of power.
        </p>
        <p>
            The primary abilities are <a href="#ability_fighting">Fighting</a>, <a href="#ability_agility">Agility</a>,
            <a href="#ability_strength">Strength</a>, <a href="#ability_endurance">Endurance</a>, <a
                href="#ability_reason">Reason</a>, <a href="#ability_intuition">Intuition</a>, and <a
                href="#ability_psyche">Psyche</a>. These primary abilities are shared by almost all characters in the
            Marvel Universe — they are a measuring stick of how well a character can perform certain acts. Primary
            abilities are also called fixed abilities because while they may be improved over time, they do not normally
            change from adventure to adventure. All primary abilities have a rank and rank number.
        </p>
        <p>
            Secondary abilities are <a href="#ability_health">Health</a>, <a href="#ability_karma">Karma</a>, <a
                href="#ability_resources">Resources</a>, and <a href="#ability_popularity">Popularity</a>. These are
            sometimes called variable abilities, as they may change within the course of a single adventure. All normal
            individuals and most characters the players encounter have secondary abilities. Secondary abilities may be
            defined by ranks or separate numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Special abilities are skills and abilities that are not common to all characters, and indeed may be unique
            to a particular character. These include all <a href="#ability_powers">Powers</a>, <a
                href="#ability_talents">Talents</a>, <a href="/system/equipment.html">Equipment</a>, and <a
                href="#ability_contacts">Contacts</a>. Special abilities use rank numbers or modify existing rank
            numbers.

            Ranks labeled "Shift" are normally used for actions that are moved by modifiers above or below the Feeble
            and Unearthly ranks on the <a href="#extended_universal_table">Universal Table</a>. Class 1000, 3000,
            5000, and Beyond levels are not available to
            most heroes, but are used to define such powerful universal forces as Eternity and Galactus.
        </p>
        <p>
            The rank range includes all the rank numbers for that range. A character with a Strength of 15 can be said
            to have Good Strength. The Hero rank numbers above the rank range are for use with existing heroes in the
            Marvel Universe. Spider-Man, for example, has Remarkable Fighting ability (his initial rank number is 30). A
            new hero entering the Marvel Universe with Remarkable Fighting ability would have a rank number of 26. This
            is because established characters in the Marvel Universe can be assumed to have been improving their skills
            over some time.

            At this point you have your Marvel Super Hero, either from those provided or one of your own creation. Now
            let's talk about how the character is used in the game.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the role-playing situation, you are cast as your hero. You, the player, are a puppeteer, controlling the
            actions and reactions of your character. Your character is limited in what he or she can do as a result of
            the character's abilities. Any time you check against these abilities to see if you complete an action, you
            are making a FEAT roll.
        </p>
        <h3 id="time_scale_the_turn">Time Scale — The Turn</h3>
        <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
        <p>
            The MARVEL SUPER HEROES game is played in turns, also called rounds. Each turn is six seconds of "real" time
            (about the amount of time that takes place in a panel of a comic story). There are therefore ten turns to a
            minute, and 600 turns to an hour.
        </p>
        <p>
            Turns are only important when time is a crucial factor, such as situations where the hero must find a bomb
            before it explodes, chase down a suspect, or battle with an opponent. Most of the time, the Judge will not
            have the players run through periods of waiting. If the heroes decide to wait ten minutes for a bus, the
            Judge does not run through all 100 6-second turns of that wait (unless, of course, a villain pounces upon
            the heroes as they wait, at which point time is suddenly crucial).
        </p>
        <p>A turn proceeds in the following fashion:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The Judge determines what is happening in the world around the heroes, involving those characters and
                actions not controlled by the players. He notes these to himself, or, if he wishes, writes them down
                (writing things down is generally time-consuming, but helps in key situations).</li>
            <li>The players in turn determine what their heroes are doing. Player's may perform more than one action
                during a turn, but this may limit the success of other actions. The players tell the judge what their
                characters are doing.</li>
            <li>Roll Initiative. Initiative is only important when one action may change or override another action. The
                side with the highest initiative has its actions take place first. Initiative is usually used in combat
                and other damage-inducing situations.</li>
            <li>Pre-Action rolls are made. In certain situations, such as defensive actions (dodging, blocking, and
                evading), a FEAT roll may be made before anyone on either sides takes any actions. These are Pre-Action
                FEATS and are rolled at this time. Certain moderator planned actions (such as explosions) may occur at
                this time. See Changing Actions, below.</li>
            <li>The actions of the side with initiative take place. Run either the Judge's or the Player's actions,
                depending on which side got the high initiative.</li>
            <li>The actions of the side that got the lower roll take place. Run the remaining side's actions.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4 id="initiative">Initiative</h4>
        <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
        After each side has decided its intended actions for a turn, each side rolls for initiative. The side with the
        higher roll is considered to have "won" initiative, and gets to move first (similar to winning the toss before a
        football game). All of one side's actions take place before the other sides. At the start of the next round,
        roll for initiative again, provided there are still at least two combatants whose actions will interfere with
        each other.
        <dl>
            <dt>Initiative Modifier</dt>
            <dd>Each side adds to its initiative mil a modifier based upon the highest Intuition on that side. This may
                allow a side with a low roll to gain initiative. A roll of "1" is always considered to be a "1." The
                initiative modifier is based on the character's rank number:</dd>
            <dt>Changing Actions</dt>
            <dd>After making an initiative roll, an action that sounded so good a moment ago sounds like not such a
                great idea afterwards. <i>Example:</i> Both you and an opponent dive for a gun kicked across the floor.
                You
                roll a 1 for initiative. It may be time to re-examine your options. Changing an action requires a yellow
                Agility FEAT, and any FEATs made after changing are at a penalty of one column shift to the left(-1CS).
                The roll for changing actions takes place in the pre-action phase of the turn.</dd>
            <dt>Negating Actions</dt>
            <dd>Losing the initiative may negate certain actions. These are lost and may not be performed during that
                turn. For example, if you are knocked out before you can land a blow, you do not get a chance to take
                your action.</dd>

        <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
        <p>
            The following are the different types of FEATs called for in the course of the game.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Ability FEATs are those that rely on one of the seven primary abilities (Fighting, Agility. Strength.
                Endurance, Reason, Intuition, and Psyche). These FEATs may be raised or lowered by Talents or the
                existing situation.</li>
            <li>Power FEATs are those that rely on one the hero's individual Powers: a character with Water Control of
                Amazing checks on the Amazing column to determine success.</li>
            <li>Talent FEATs are those that rely on the hero's Talents, where the Talent modifies a specific ability for
                FEATs.</li>
            <li>Popularity FEATs are those used in social interaction, and use the Popularity rank, and may be modified
                by Contacts.</li>
            <li>Resource FEATs are used in connection with the character's Resource rank, and determine if the character
                can afford a specific item or piece of equipment. Think of this as a "Credit Check," for now — we'll
                explain it further below.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="making_feats">Making FEATs</h3>
        <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
        <p>
            Intensity determines whether certain FEATs are feasible or not, and the type of result needed for the FEAT
            to succeed.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a FEAT does not have a given, stated intensity, assume that any color result means success. Combat FEATS
            have varying degrees of success, and as such are discussed in full in the combat section.
        </p>
        <p>
            An Intensity is set as a rank (Unearthly, Monstrous, etc.). Compare the requisite ability against the
            intensity to determine the color of the FEAT required for success. If the Intensify rank is greater than the
            Ability rank, only a red result will be successful. If the two are equal, a yellow result is needed for
            success. If the Ability rank is greater than the Intensity rank, then a green FEAT is needed. Option: if
            unstated, the Judge may declare the Intensity to be Typical.
        </p>
        <p>
            A summary of FEAT Intensities is provided in the Judge's Book. There are items with variable Intensity
            levels, such as poisons and gases. That information and the effects of these items are covered under their
            own areas in the Judge's Book.
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Automatic FEATs</dt>
            <dd>Certain actions can be assumed to be automatically successful. Picking up a normal chair is a simple
                act. and would not require a FEAT roll to determine its success. (Picking up a chair while dodging
                bullets and defusing a bomb simultaneously will require a FEAT roll. More on multiple actions later.) In
                general, if an item is more than three ranks lower in Intensity than the requisite Ability. the FEAT can
                be considered automatic, with the Judge's permission. The sole purpose for Automatic FEATs is to prevent
                the game from being dominated by die rolls. The Judge always has the power to ask for FEAT rolls. In
                some cases. items like Poisons may require FEATs regardless of the Intensity</dd>
            <dt>Impossible FEATs</dt>
            <dd>As a guideline, any action more than one rank above the ability may be considered impossible. The
                Resource FEAT is always limited in this fashion (check it out).</dd>
            <dt>Shifting the Rank</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Certain situations may result in the shifting of a column to the right or left. A shift to the right
                    is considered a positive shift (+1, +2, or +3CS, or column shift). A shift to the left, making the
                    FEAT more difficult, is considered a negative shift (-1, -2, or -3CS). Column Shifts are primarily
                    involved as per specific situations (trying to lift an object on a slippery incline may result in a
                    shift of -1 or -2CS). Those involved in combat are discussed in the combat section.</p>
                <p>Shifting of ranks may make certain FEATs automatic (or impossible). No FEAT may be shifted to the
                    left below Shift 0 or to the right above Shift-Z. Anything in the Class 1000. Class 3000, Class 5000
                    or Beyond columns may not be shifted, except in specific circumstances listed for that FEAT.</p>

        <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
        <p>

            Now that we've looked at the mechanics of making FEATs, let's look at the specific types we talked about
            briefly above: Ability FEATs, Power FEATs, Talent FEATs, Popularity FEATs and Resource FEATs.
        </p>
        <h4 id="ability_feats">Ability FEATs</h4>
        <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
        <p>
            Ability FEATs are those that come directly from the seven basic abilities: Fighting, Agility, Strength.
            Endurance, Reason, Intuition, and Psyche. When making an Ability FEAT, the specific ability is normally
            noted in the text (such as a Psyche FEAT in regards to Mind Control). Often a specific color FEAT is
            required, such as a yellow Endurance FEAT. The particular FEATs that apply to specific abilities are
            noted in the Abilities section in the last chapter. Two types of Ability FEATs should be discussed in
            detail at this time, both of which revolve around the Strength ability. The first is the problem of
            lifting things, the second breaking through other items.
        </p>
        <h5 id="lifting_things">Lifting Things</h5>
        <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
        <p>
            The Strength ability, combined with the Intensity of an object's weight, determines how much the
            character can lift. As noted above, lifting a weight more than three ranks below the character's
            Strength can be considered automatic, those one rank below the character's Strength require a
            green FEAT; those of equal Intensity to the character's Strength require a yellow FEAT; those on
            one rank higher require a red FEAT; and those beyond one rank higher are impossible.

            <i>Example:</i> Spider-Man's Strength is set at Incredible (40). (The Amazing Spider-Man refers to his
            Agility.) He could lift something of up to 400 pounds without effort under ordinary
            circumstances (them may be circumstances which would require a FEAT roll). From 400 to about 1
            ton is a green FEAT roll. From 1 ton up to 10 tons requires a yellow FEAT roil. Over 10 tons
            (but no more than 50 tons) would require a red FEAT roll, and likely require spending of Karma.
        </p>
        <h5 id="breaking_things">Breaking Things</h5>
        <p>
            Most inanimate objects have a "damage-resistance" intensity, called material strength of an object.
        </p>
        <p>
            To break through, rip up, or generally damage a material, a character must make a Strength FEAT against
            that material strength. Success indicates a two-foot-wide hole, maximum, carved in the side. The
            material strength of the material determines the result needed for a successful FEAT (green, yellow, or
            red).
        </p>
        <p>
            The listed values are for materials between two inches and 12 inches thick. If the material is less than
            2" thick, lower the material strength by one rank. If the material is between 1 and 2 feet thick, raise
            the material strength by one rank. If the material strength is over 2 feet thick, raise the material
            strength by 2 ranks for purposes of determining damage.

        <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
        <p>Power FEATs are similar to Ability FEATs, save that the player uses the Power instead of the Ability to
            pull off the FEAT: Powers and their uses are listed in the back of the book.</p>
        <p>For example, Wall-Crawling is a Power, whether by molecular charge suppression (Spider-Man), suction cups
            (the late Fly), or microscopic molecular hooks (Nightcrawler), and has a Power rank. The Wall-Crawling
            Power rank is used to determine FEATs when using that Power (sticking to a oilsoaked steel wall, for
            example).</p>
        <p>Most powers have a range. Some are stated as "touch" or only operating over a given distance. Those that

            Therefore, someone with Remarkable magnetic manipulation could affect objects 8 areas away, while a
            character (one would hope a non-player character) with Class 5000 magnetic manipulation could manipulate
            items on the Moon.

        <p>
            There are some cases when a hero may use a Power in a way it was not originally intended to carry out a
            certain task. These are known as Power Stunts.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, a character with the Speed Power suddenly decides to run in a circle very fast, creating a
            whirlwind. Or a character with Leaping Power decides to use his powerful leg muscles to disrupt the
            ground, knocking over an opponent. Or our example above, the wall-crawler decides to use his
            stick-to-it-ness to grapple a thief. These are Power Stunts. Certain Powers, such as weather elemental
            controls, almost entirely consist of these stunts.
        </p>
        <p>
            The players will, without a doubt, come up with an innumerable amount of stunts for their Powers (and
            the Judge will be told how to decide if a Power Stunt is possible in his Judge’s Book). The basic
            question to be asked is: Has this hero done this sort of thing before?
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are playing an established Marvel Super Hero, the question of whether he has done this stunt
            before or not is determined from the Marvel Comics themselves. Each time you can spot him using this
            particular stunt, that counts as one time. <i>Example:</i> In one issue of X-Men, Nightcrawler uses his
            power
            to make three quick teleports, behind three separate opponents. He does it again several issues later.
            This means he has pulled this Power Stunt twice.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are playing a hero of your own creation, or a hero that you have never seen perform this stunt,
            this means you have never performed it before. In either case, the Judge may say "no" to a stunt, it he
            feels it unbalances the character.
        </p>
        <p>
            The type of FEAT (made against the Power rank) needed to make a Power Stunt is determined by the number
            of times your character has tried it.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Never tried it — red FEAT roll</li>
            <li>Tried it up to three times — yellow FEAT roll</li>
            <li>Tried it more than three times — green FEAT roll</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In addition, a character making a Power Stunt must lay out 100 Karma points to make the roll (in
            addition to any other Karma he may spend — see Karma). Spending the Karma does not guarantee success;
            it only ensures that yes, the character can try the stunt. If the stunt is ruled impossible by the
            Judge, no Karma is spent.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a player character has tried a stunt more then ten times, it is considered to be part of his or her
            bag al tricks for that Power, and a FEAT roll is not necessary to say if it is possible (this is similar
            to purchasing another Power in full, but allowing the player to use the Power as he is paying for it).
        </p>
        <p>
            Failing the FEAT means the Power Stunt has failed. The manner of failure will depend entirely on the
            situation. For the wall-crawler trying to grapple, the Power may fail to operate. For the speedster
            running in circles, the whirlwind may be uncontrollable. For Nightcrawler trying a triple 'port, he may
            get only one guy. The Judge is instructed that while the failure may be life-endangering, it should not
            be initially or immediately deadly.
        </p>
        <h4 id="talent_feats">Talent FEATs</h4>
        <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
        <p>
            Talents are used in two fashions. In the first case, they may modify the abilities of the character in
            specific instances.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, take the Science and Professional Talents. A Talent in Biology gives you a +1CS on Reason
            FEATs which involve Biology. The players are encouraged to use this whenever they can get away with it,
            within reason. While said character with Biology cannot identify the presence of radiation any better
            than the next guy, he can look at the plant life and from that deduce (with his +1CS) that there is or
            was a radiation source in the area. (The moral of the story is, players should get creative when using
            Talents.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Certain Talents do not modify Talent FEATs. They either provide for specific abilities (such as First
            Aid) or special backgrounds (such as Mystic Origin or Heir to Fortune).
        </p>
        <h4 id="popularity_feats">Popularity FEATs</h4>
        <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
        <p>
            A Popularity FEAT is used whenever you want to get something from someone else. This may be borrowing a
            car from a friend, getting a hot tip from a police sergeant, finagling a favor from a newspaper
            columnist, or prying information from a stoolie, as well as getting special equipment from the
            government or persuading a terrorist to surrender. Popularity is a measure of personal charm, charisma,
            and good looks, combined with the hero's reputation for honesty and fair play (Spider-Man is a nice guy,
            but thanks to the Daily Bugle he usually can't get the time of day).
        </p>
        <h5 id="using_popularity">Using Popularity</h5>
        <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
        <p>When dealing one on one with a non-player character, that NPC usually has a predisposition to the hero of
            either Friendly, Neutral, Unfriendly, or Hostile.</p>
        <p>Friendly characters and organizations include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Close friends and relatives of the hero</li>
            <li>Listed Contacts for the hero Neutral characters and organizations include:</li>
            <li>People who have never met the hero, but have heard about him</li>
            <li>Other heroes, unless they have worked together before</li>
            <li>Large groups of strangers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Unfriendly characters and organizations include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>People who have never met or heard of the hero</li>
            <li>Total strangers</li>
            <li>Individuals with opposite Popularity (negative if the hero is positive, and vice versa)</li>
            <li>Neutral characters whom the character has offended, perhaps by not returning something</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Hostile characters and organizations include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>People who are actively opposing the hero and his goals</li>
            <li>Sworn enemies</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Enemies and people the character has hurt are considered totally Hostile, and will not under normal
            circumstances even listen to the hero, much less go along with his ideas. (There are exceptions to this.
            For example, if the character is getting something out of the deal, he may be more willing to go along
            with it).
        </p>
        <p>
            A Popularity FEAT is rolled against the character's Popularity rank number. This determines in which
            rank it will fall (example: a Popularity of 45 is rolled on the Incredible column).
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Friendly targets require a green FEAT</li>
            <li>Neutral targets require a yellow FEAT</li>
            <li>Unfriendly targets require a red FEAT</li>
            <li>Hostile targets are impossible FEATs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The effects of success or failure depend on the group and the thing sought. A failure for a Friendly
            group is a polite refusal, usually with a good reason ("I'm sorry, but the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier is
            not available - company policy.") A failure for a Neutral group is a curt refusal and potential for the
            group becoming Unfriendly. A failure for an Unfriendly group means the individual or group turns ugly,
            and the hero may be attacked.

            Popularity FEATs are used only when dealing with NPCs (whether by players or other NPCs). A Popularity
            FEAT is never used against the players to force them to perform actions against their wills (normally).
        </p>
        <h5 id="negative_popularity">Negative Popularity</h5>
        <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
        <p>
            There are charismatic bad guys like Doctor Doom, whose very evil bends others to their will. There are
            also those powerful characters such as Rhino and Juggernaut, from whom people flee. Finally, there are
            heroes, who through bad press or prejudice (mutants) suffer from a negative Popularity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Negative Popularity operates as positive Popularity, save that it ignores whether the target is
            friendly, neutral, or unfriendly. Everything is a yellow FEAT. The only modifier that comes into play is
            if the request is in the target's best interests ("Run, you dolts!" is in the target's interest).
            Characters with negative Popularity can never approach individuals other than Contacts for items and
            favors (which is why theft is always a major pan of criminal behavior) .
        </p>
        <p>
            A Negative Popularity is represented as a minus "-" before the word, such as "- Typical" (-5
            Popularity). A character with negative Popularity suffers penalties in receiving Karma.
        </p>
        <h4 id="resource_feats">Resource FEATs</h4>
        <a href="#top">Back to top</a>

        <p>
            To purchase anything, a character must make a Resource FEAT. This is the equivalent of a credit check,
            or rattling the piggy bank, or checking the bank account to see how much cash is available. This is over
            and above that amount necessary to get by on.
        </p>
        <p>
            A Resource FEAT may be made by a character once per week. If a Resource FEAT has been made by a
            character in the previous seven days, any Resource FEATs following automatically fail.
        </p>
        <p>
            A Resource FEAT is figured in almost the same fashion as a normal FEAT, with one important exception. A
            lone character may not try to purchase an item with a higher rank than his Resource rank. Other rules
            apply – if a Resource rank is three ranks lower, the purchase is automatic; if one or two less than the
            Resource rank, a green FEAT is needed, and if equal, then a yellow FEAT is needed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Success indicates the hero may purchase the item in question. Failure indicates the item is more
            expensive than he can afford. He cannot try for any other item of that rank or higher for the next week.
            Then he can make another attempt for that item, or another item (this represents the idea of saving up
            for a purchase).
        </p>
        <h5 id="bank_loans_option">Bank Loans Option</h5>
        <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
        <p>
            Characters may purchase something up to one rank higher than their Resource rank through a lending
            institution. The character then has to worry about making a Resource FEAT each month of two ranks less
            for as many months as the rank number of the item. Failure to pay results in the bank taking back the
            item in question. There are other institutions that lend money. They employ seven-foot tall gentlemen
            named Guido to collect.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Example:</i> Peter Parker has a Poor Resource rank, and his apartment building rent is Poor as well.
            He makes a yellow FEAT roll to see if he can pay his rent. Failure indicates he cannot pay that week and
            may try to make it up the next week (providing he gives Mrs. Muggins a decent excuse for not tossing him
            out). Success means that he keeps Mrs. Muggins off his back for another month.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Example:</i> Tony Stark has an Excellent Resource rank. He wants to buy a car with a Good rank. He
            can do so with a green FEAT (failure indicates a cash flow problem -- he doesn't have it at the moment).
            He can pay for a night on the town (Typical) without making a FEAT roll.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Example:</i> Tony Stark used to run Stark International, a Large Corporation with Incredible
            Resources. Incredible Resources allow them to buy their boss a car for off ice use, but they may have to
            borrow money from the banks to rebuild the damage done by Iron Man's battle with Obadiah Stane.

            Individuals may help each other in performing FEATs (lifting a car, researching the function of an alien
            device, etc.). Check the ability both characters are using. If the lower of the two characters is within
            one rank of the higher, the character with the higher ability receives a +1CS benefit to the FEAT. This
            benefit may be used in cases of using complementary Powers for the same FEAT as well, provided that
            Power aids the situation .
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Example One:</i> Vision, with Amazing(50) Strength, helps She-Hulk (Monstrous(75) Strength) pull up
            an overturned crane. The column checked for the FEAT is Unearthly (Monstrous shifted one to the right).

        <p>
            <i>Example Two:</i> Sunspot, with Remarkable(30) Strength, helps She-Hulk lift up the crane. The column
            checked is still Monstrous, since Sunspot's Strength is significantly lower than She-Hulk's
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Example Three:</i> Shaman summons a wind of Amazing (50) intensity to help She-Hulk lift the crane.
            Should the Judge decide that the power complements the ability that is being checked, the FEAT is rolled
            on the Unearthly column. Otherwise, it is rolled on the Monstrous column. (If the Judge has good reason,
            such as the wind blowing up a lot of stinging dust, he may make the FEAT an Amazing FEAT owing to the
            added difficulty).
        </p>
        <h5 id="more_than_one_action_in_the_same_round">More than One Action in the Same Round</h5>
        <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
        <p>
            In noncombat situations, characters who perform more than one action in the same round may do so with
            the note that the actions may require a larger FEAT than previously.
        </p>
        <p>
            A character may perform up to three noncombat actions in a round, or one combat action and one
            non-combat action (for multiple combat operations, check in the Combat section). The difficulty of the
            FEATs is raised, however.
        </p>
        <p>
            If both actions are Automatic, they both may be performed in a single round without either FEAT being
            increased.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the tougher action requires a green FEAT, then both actions will require yellow FEATs to succeed.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the tougher action requires a yellow FEAT, then both actions will require red FEATs to succeed.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the tougher action requires a red FEAT then both actions may not be performed in the same round (or
            rather, both will fail).
