                    The hero possesses artificially-created armor that provides protection and possibly a way of
                    possessing other Powers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Armor comes in many forms exotic plate-mail, nuclear-powered exoskeletons, or mechanically-created
                    force fields. The player should work with the Judge to create proper Armor for his hero. The player
                    can also determine which Powers are possessed by the hero and which are properties of the armor.
                    Powers built into the armor can later be modified and enhanced; think of the changes Tony Stark has
                    made in the Iron Man armor. On the other hand, Powers that are built into the armor may suffer
                    mechanical failure. The Armor's Power rank determines its ability to resist damage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The player also has to determine where he got the Armor in the first place. This is covered in the
                    "Character Creation" section elsewhere in this book. If the hero gained the armor through an
                    accident, he might not be able to repair it.

                <p>
                    This is the type of field used by the Invisible Woman. It provides protection against a variety of
                    forces, including brute force, energy attacks, and extreme temperature conditions. It can be
                    projected and used for a variety of Power stunts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The following seven force fields protect against specific forms of attack. Each protects the hero
                    and the surrounding area. The maximum size of the force field is the number of areas equal to 10% of
                    the Power rank number. For example, a Monstrous Force Field can protect 7.5 areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The force field completely absorbs any attack which has an Intensity equal to or less than the
                    Power's rank number. If the Intensity is higher, it is reduced by the Power's rank number. The
                    remaining Intensity breaches the force field and affects anyone within by this diminished effect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These forms cannot be used for many of the Power stunts suggested for force fields as given in the
                    Player's Book.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These cannot be used to physically attack or to handle solid materials. However, the hero can
                    develop Power stunts which reflect each form's special nature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The hero can form shields to protect distant targets at +2CS range.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By expanding his field outward, the hero can sweep his surroundings clean of anything affected by
                    his force field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Power can be used as a filter to sort out anything affected by his force field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The force field can be formed around something it would affect, thus trapping it. The hero can move
                    the "trap" at will up to +2CS by means of a red FEAT.

                    hero, it does not provide life support materials. For example, this Power permits the hero to walk
                    unharmed on the surface of Venus, provided he has his own oxygen supply.

                <p>
                    The hero can turn any attack back onto the attacker. The attack may be of any nature: brute force,
                    Power, or magic. The Power absorbs the energy of the attack up to this rank and redirects it. A
                    Typical FEAT send the attack off in a random direction. An Amazing FEAT reflects some of the attack
                    back onto the attacker; it is now -3CS in Intensity. An Unearthly FEAT sends the entire attack back
                    onto the attacker. If the attack's Intensity is higher that this Power's rank, some of the damage
                    passes through and affects the hero. The Power rank is subtracted from the attack's Intensity. While
                    most of the attack is reflected, the remainder gets through to the hero.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example: The terrible Turnabout is battling X-Factor. Cyclops fires an optic blast of Remarkable
                    Intensity. Turnabout possesses Excellent Reflection. His Power splits the blast in two. A Feeble
                    blast penetrates his Power and knocks Turnabout back. The bulk of the blast was reflected. Turnabout
                    made an Amazing FEAT, so some of Cyclops' blast returns to him. Cyke takes Typical damage from his
                    own Power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Normally, this Power is consciously controlled and only appears when the hero wills it. However, the
                    Power can be turned against the hero by such means as <a href="#control">Power
                        Control</a>/Magnification and <a href="#domination">Power Domination</a>. In such cases, the
                    Power can be magnified beyond the hero's control to a level where it reflects everything, including
                    air, food, and water.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Power can be used indefinitely, so long as it isn't overcome by superior force. After the first
                    time the Power is breached, the hero must make a green FEAT. Failure to do so means his Power has
                    failed. After the second breach, the hero must make a yellow FEAT. For each breach following that,
                    he must make a red FEAT. This applies to a continual use of the Power. If his Power fails, the hero
                    cannot regain it until 24 hours have passed.

                    function as normal microscopes. This allows the hero to see things as small as chromosomes. Beyond
                    this level, light no longer carries images. The second stage of this Power is a variation of
                    Clairvoyance that permits the hero to see miniature, rather than distant, targets. The Power
                    automatically shifts between these stages without the hero's conscious choice. (Rank: FE =

                    vision to perceive. The eyes function as telescopes, magnifying normal visual images. With this
                    Power, the hero can see anything in his line of sight, even the surfaces of distant worlds. However,
                    the Power is limited by the speed of light. Images of Alpha Centauri, for example, are five years

                    The hero can generate and control the extra-dimensional energy-form known as "Darkforce." This
                    resembles a tangible, impenetrable shadow and possesses several unique characteristics that the hero
                    can use to develop Power Stunts:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Blunt attack damage at Power rank.</li>

                <p>
                    The Darkforce is as yet undefined in the Marvel Universe. For your game's purposes, you might simply
                    treat it as an other-dimensional power source that fills its own entire pocket dimension. That
                    definition will work in or out of the official Marvel Universe.

                    The hero can transform energy into a matrix that simulates solid matter. This matrix may be any
                    shape the hero desires, although greater complexity requires a higher Intensity FEAT to create. For
                    example, simple solids can be formed by a Feeble FEAT. Animated forms require a Typical FEAT.
                    Likenesses and simple machinery require an Incredible FEAT. The energy matrix possesses Strength
                    equal to the Power rank. It continues to exist for a duration determined by the hero's Psyche. After
                    that time, the matrix harmlessly dissipates. Some of the uses for this Power include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Forming cages or barriers.</li>
                    <li>Forming servants to perform desired tasks.</li>
                    <li>Creating Body Armor to protect and enhance the hero's abilities.</li>
                    <li>At high levels, the hero can build semi-permanent structures at will.</li>

                <p>

                    The hero can control gravity, the force that attracts all particles to all other particles. Gravity
                    always exists wherever there is tangible matter. (in dimensions composed entirely of energy, though,
                    gravity is optional.) The hero doesn't really generate gravity; he simply changes the Intensity of
                    what's already there. He can increase or decrease the Intensity of gravity by his Power rank number.
                    This effect may be centered on himself or projected onto a target. This permit him to develop a

                    <li>Sinking ships by making their weight exceed their buoyancy.</li>

                    plasma's Intensity and reduce its damage by his Power rank number. The Power includes Power rank
                    Resistance to plasma's effects.

                    The Power has two main uses. The first is shaping plasma fields into any shape desired. This can be
                    developed into a variety of Power stunts as the hero develops numerous plasma-constructs to perform
                    various deeds. Such constructs do possess the typical side-effects of plasma fields, and dissipate
                    upon cessation of the Power.

                <p>
                    The second use of Plasma Control enables the hero to counteract plasma-related Powers. These include
                    Plasma Generation, Energy Doppelganger, Energy Sheath, and Energy Body. The target's Power rank
                    determines the required intensity of the FEAT. For example, an Excellent Intensity FEAT is required
                    to control Excellent <a href="#plasma_generation">Plasma Generation</a>.

                    This Power enables the hero to affect normal shadows and, indirectly, light as well. The hero can
                    shift the location and size of normal shadows. He can form them into two-dimensional images that can
                    do Power rank damage to real targets. The hero can also Remote Sense through these
                    shadow-constructs. The hero can increase or decrease the Intensity of any shadow, whether natural or
                    Power-based, by his Power rank number. This overlaps with Light Generation and Shadowcasting but
                    differs in that either effect is possible and only existing shadows or shadow-related Powers are
                    affected.

                <p>
                    The hero has the ability to see through any shadow as if it were a normally-lit area, provided its

        <p>
            Power can be emitted by any part of the hero's body. For most Powers, it is not important to specify the
            emergence point. For the Powers of the Energy Emission class, though, emission points become important. This
            affects how the hero utilizes his Power. It determines ways goes can negate that Power. If the hero loses
            the part of his body containing the emission point, he may lose his Power as well. When creating the hero,
            the player should determine an, emission point for any Energy Emission Powers. He may select the first one
            rolled as the point for all of his character's Energy Emissions, or be adventurous and determine one for
            each Power.

                    The hero can create realistic holographic images that have apparent solidity. These Illusions can be
                    mechanically detected and recorded by such means as photography or television. That separates this
                    Power from the psionic, image-generating Power called Hallucinations, which produces images directly
                    in the target's mind and cannot affect mechanical senses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Illusion can take any size or appearance the hero desires and is limited only by his
                    imagination. The Illusion can be a realistic simulation, a fanciful creation direct from the hero's
                    mind, or an abstract display of light. The hero is playing with light itself and can create anything
                    that is visible. Since most people depend. on vision to gain information on their surroundings, this
                    Power presents the awesome ability to apparently alter the nature of reality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The hero can cast his Illusions anywhere within his Power rank range, though he must be able to
                    clearly see the area where the Illusion is forming if he wants to make it at all realistic. The
                    normal limit for unaided vision is one area (132 feet). Beyond that range the hero can no longer
                    clearly see his Illusion's surroundings and thus cannot alter the Illusion to reflect things going
                    on around the Illusion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, an Illusionary tree cast two areas away might seem to be floating a discreet two inches
                    above the ground.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the hero is unconcerned about maintaining the reality of his Illusions, this limit can be
                    ignored. The hero does not even need to be able to see the Illusion as it forms. Such uncontrolled
                    Illusions appear as transparent, free- floating apparitions. If the Illusion takes the form of a
                    living being, viewers might see it as a ghost or other phantom form. If the hero possesses a means
                    of extending the range of his senses, he can maintain the realism m of his Illusion at up to full
                    range of both this Power and that of whatever means he uses to extend his vision. Ways of increasing
                    the senses' range include mechanical means such as binoculars and remote TV cameras and
                    sense-extending Powers, most notably Telescopic Vision and Clairvoyance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example: Deetee has an Incredible rank and can Illusion-Cast up to two miles away. She also has a
                    good pair of binoculars that enable her to see up to one mile away. For idle amusement, she likes to
                    go to the top of tall buildings and Cast Illusions at the pedestrians below. She also like to find
                    the monitors for remote surveillance cameras and use them to direct her Illusions into locked rooms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Illusions last as long as the hero concentrates on maintaining their existence. The Judge is free to
                    determine how long the hero can maintain his concentration in a given circumstance. Breaking the
                    hero's concentration abruptly terminates the Illusion, while merely getting distracted causes the
                    Illusion to begin to lose realism (drift, lose detail, become translucent, and so on). The
                    Illusion's effect on a viewer varies. A viewer must make an Intuition FEAT against the Power rank of
                    the Illusion-caster; success means the viewer now recognizes the Illusion's true nature. Players
                    running characters viewing an Illusion are only allowed to make a FEAT if they suspect the Illusion.
                    This can occur if they physically touch the Illusion, if the Illusion is somehow flawed, or if the
                    character is just naturally cynical. ("Congratulations, Les. So far this morning you have attempted
                    to disbelieve the existence of a flying saucer, Galactus, two muggers, and your breakfast."). Since
                    Illusion-Casting includes the Power of Light Control, Illusions can provide a measure of protection
                    against light-based attacks. An Illusory tent would provide protection against both infrared and
                    ultraviolet light, thus keeping the hero cool and safe from sunburn. Treat this Power as +2CS
                    Resistance to Light-based attacks. It does not provide protection against any of the other ways Moms
                    Nature has of affecting us. That Illusory tent would be drafty, cold, and flimsy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Illusion Casting can be combined with other Powers to give 1he Illusion enhanced realism; this can
                    also create Illusions that do real physical damage. If the Illusion-caster has any of the Energy
                    Emission Powers, these can be redirected to apparently originate from the Illusion rather than from
                    the hero.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, combining this Power with Plasma Generation would simulate the Phoenix-force and fry
                    any electronics in the area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More commonly, the power is used to disguise the true nature of anything the hero or her companions
                    might be doing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example: Deetee and her buddy Jayboy have to break into a certain building that they know is under
                    surveillance. Deetee doesn't care about subtlety, only About distraction, and casts an Illusion of
                    a,.Large elephant that comes lumbering around a corner and lies down in front of the door. Inside
                    the elephantine Illusion,
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jayboy is free to use his Kinetic Bolt Power to smash open the door. He also uses his K-bolts to
                    simulate the effect the elephant's legs have when they kick against a target.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main drawback to Illusion-Casting is that the hero must keep his Power's true nature a secret
                    from his adversaries. It must be presented as if it were another Power entirely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, although she is an Illusion-caster, Deetee often presents herself as a Demon-Summoner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even if the Power's nature is public knowledge, the Power is still effective. The Powers of Light
                    Emission and Light Control are innate factors of Illusion Casting. As such, the hero has the ability
                    to generate any intensity and frequency of light. He can warp light, alter its frequency, and change
                    its degree of coherency. The hero can do -2CS rank level damage using light-based attacks. As noted
                    earlier, the Power includes - 2CS Resistance to Light-based attacks; the hero simply casts an
                    Illusion of something opaque between herself and the offending light. The hero can simulate other
                    visual Powers or Talents with some effectiveness as well; the -2CS limit is used as a guide for
                    determining how well the hero can do these things.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example: Once inside the building, Deetee and Jay-boy discover a guard. Deetee casts an Illusion of
                    Ringmaster and tries to hypnotize the guard. Her Incredible rank is reduced to merely Excellent when
                    she tries simulate Hypnotic Control. Fortunately that is enough; the guard falls under the spurious
                    Ringmaster's control.

                <p>
                    A drawback in characters who have this Power is that they tend to become philosophical about the
                    relationship between Reality and Illusion. Companions find themselves drawn into interminable
                    arguments about what is real and what is not. Illusion-Casters may even begin to feel that they
                    themselves are an Illusion being cast by some unknown being.

                    The hero has the ability to consciously alter the physiology of a target. This is accomplished by
                    sheer force of will and does not require any physical action on the hero's part, aside from touching
                    the target. The Power can be used at a distance but each 10 feet separating the hero from the target
                    reduces his effective Power by -1CS. The Power is normally concentrated on a single target, but the
                    hero can affect as many targets as he desires. Each additional target also decreases the rank -1CS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, trying to affect two targets at a distance of 10 feet drops the hero's rank -4CS (-2CS
                    per target).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The result of any form of this Power is permanent. (What's the point of healing somebody if he's
                    just going to drop dead later, right?) The actual ongoing effects continue for as long as the hero
                    continues to use his Power. Once this is done, the target's natural healing abilities and rates
                    revert to normal. There are seven forms of Biophysical Control, each with its own set of effects.
                    The first four forms are benevolent, the last three are maievolent. Heroes who use the malevolent
                    forms against sentient beings risk Karma and Popularity loss. When the hero is created, the player
                    must choose one of these forms.

                    <dd>
                        The hero can cure the damage caused by wounds, trauma, toxins', and disease. The hero can
                        increase the target's Health by'an amount equal to the Power rank level. This is the maximum
                        benefit the hero can give per day to one specific person. The color of the required FEAT is
                        determined by the nature and severity of the damage. Green FEATs handle broken bones,
                        non-terminal disease, and simple wounds. Yellow FEATs handle physical trauma, wounds to organs,
                        non-fatal poisoning, and terminal diseases. Red FEATs handle mortal wounds, coronary attacks,
                        strokes, toxic poisoning, and massive physical trauma. The Power seals the body and returns any
                        still-living tissues to health. It cannot replace lost tissue.

                        The hero has the ability to heal (as above) and can recreate large areas of lost tissue, such as
                        severed limbs or destroyed organs. Limbs are regrown by a green FEAT, organs by a yellow FEAT,
                        and brain and neural tissues by a red FEAT.

                            The hero can actually bring the dead back to life. The Power rank number is the maximum
                            number of days the target can have been deceased and still be revived. The condition of the
                            corpse determines the color of the required FEAT. An intact, unembalmed, undecayed corpse is
                            revived on a green FEAT. A decayed but intact corpse needs a yellow FEAT. A red FEAT is
                            required for partial or embalmed remains.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, a Good rank can revive a10-day-old, slightly moldy body if the player rolls a
                            75 or better.

                            The Power begins by healing and regenerating any damage to the body, especially the cause of
                            death. Once the body is habitable again, the Power automatically summons the deceased spirit
                            back and reconnects it with the body. If the spirit was already reincar- nated into another
                            body, the spirit splits into identical halves. One remains with the new body while the other
                            half returns home. If the spirit is trapped, the hero can make an attempt to free him based
                            on the Power rank of whatever is holding the spirit. Until the spirit returns, the body
                            remains in a comatose state.

                        The hero can heal another by apparently taking that damage from the victim and moving it into
                        the hero. The Power first heals the target; the manner is the same as for Healing (above).
                        Simultaneously, the hero's body reshapes itself into a duplication of the damage being healed.
                        Once the target is healed, the hero's Self-Healing abilities (same rank) then cures this ersatz
                        damage. A hero cannot heal another person until he has returned to normal.

                        The hero can accelerate the cellular collapse of body tissue. The Power can cause Power rank
                        damage per turn. The target becomes leprous, dies, and quickly crumbles to dust if the Power is
                        used long enough.

                        The Power can upset the Smooth functioning of the physiology. The target suffers Power rank
                        losses to his Health as he suffers anything from minor discomfort (nausea, chills) to fatal
                        trauma (coronary attack).

                    <dd>
                        The Power can accelerate or reverse the aging process. The normal rate is multiplied by the
                        Power rank number. For example, a Good rank can make aging occur at tenfold rate or go in
                        reverse at an equal rate. A green FEAT accelerates aging. A yellow FEAT stops it. A red FEAT
                        reverses it. As the victim's age changes, physiology and mental capacities change as well. While
                        the Power can function as a Fountain of Youth, it can also be used to kill through old age or
                        regression to protoplasm. A target can be protected from unwanted

                    The hero is in tune with the entire scope of reality. He possesses a detached, omniscient viewpoint
                    that allows him to explore the entire existence of a chosen subject. Unfortunately, this causes such
                    a massive overload of superfluous information that the hero is hard pressed to sort it all out. The
                    FEAT represents the hero's ability to recover a specific bit of information from all the effluvia.
                    The more exact the required detail, the higher the difficulty. Discovering basic facts or locating
                    any one on the Earth requires a green FEAT. Complex information or finding anyone within a star
                    system requires a yellow FEAT. Secrets, weaknesses, arcane knowledge, and anything else the Judge
                    wants to make difficult to find out requires a red FEAT.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Power can be used to automatically track any Class 1000 or higher Power within ten miles of the
                    hero's position. In combat the Power raises the hero's own attacks +1CS by detecting the weak points
                    in the opponent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The major drawback to this Power is that can lead to insanity, especially catatonic withdrawal, as
                    the hero's Psyche is continually inundated by a flood of information. The Judge can determine the
                    chance of temporary insanity by secretly making a Reason FEAT for the hero; a green, yellow, or red
                    FEAT means the hero has retained all his marbles for another day. The Judge should make this check
                    any time the hero uses the Power more than five times a day or a number equal to 10% of the Power
                    rank number, whichever is higher. Because of this, caution is urged in the use of this Power. If the
                    Power is somehow negated, the hero may also go into a state of shock or severe depression. Any
                    mental problems the hero suffers can be cured by normal psychotherapy.

                Normally a character's Intelligence is determined in the Character Generation Process. However, the
                research for the Ultimate Powers Book showed that extreme levels of Intelligence can be a Power in its
                own right. Examples include The Leader and the late Soviet scientist known only as Gargoyle. The
                hyper-intelligent character is a genius of awesome potential. He can quickly master new subjects, retain
                that knowledge indefinitely, and easily succeed in any mental endeavor.
                There are two ways the Power can be incorporated into a character. The player should choose one when he
                first creates the character (a coin toss will do).
                The first method is a permanent modification of the hero's Intelligence. The Power rank number is added
                to the hero's previously generated Reason or Intuition rank number. The total is the hero's actual
                Hyper-intelligence. For example, a character like the Leader started off with Good Reason. The gamma
                rays added Incredible Hyper- Intelligence for a final total of Amazing Reason rank.
                The second method uses Hyper- Intelligence the same way most other Powers are used-intermittently. Just
                as
                Siryn doesn't scream all the time, so too would a Hyper-intelligent character have normal intelligence
                most of the time. When he uses his Power, he transforms himself into a mental giant. The way it operates
                is the character's normal rank for either Reason or Intuition is raised the number of levels equal to
                the Power rank (Feeble is +1CS, Poor +2CS, and so on). The total is the actual Hyper-Intelligence rank
                the character can achieve using this Power. The hero can retain this higher rank for a limited amount of
                time; the duration is the number of minutes equal to the original Ability's rank number. This is for the
                first time each day the hero uses the Power. Each successive time the hero uses his Power within the
                same day decreases the duration -1CS.
                Example: Steve is creating an awesomely wise alien named Shepherd. Shepherd has a normal Incredible
                Intuition rank. His Power rank is Excellent. This raises the Intuition rank by +5CS to a potential
                Shift-Y rank. Shepherd can retain this enhanced state for an Excellent duration of 40 minutes before he
                reverts to normal. summoning his Power a second time, he returns to Shift-Y Intuition for a Remarkable
                duration of only 30 minutes. He can summon his Power five more times after that, then he has to rest.
                When creating the character, the player can increase the Power rank +1CS by specializing in a specific
                fields. After all, comics are filled with characters who are titans in the lab but failures in other
                fields. Possible fields include Professional and other Talents, such as Medicine, Engineering, and
                Animal Training.
                Optional Powers include Hyper-Invention and Total Memory.
                The Nemesis is Mind Drain.

                    This is the form Body Armor most heroes want. The hero's body is composed of apparently normal
                    flesh. However, the tissue of capable of withstanding major damage without showing any effects. The
                    resistance covers physical and energy attacks only.

                <p>
                    The Intensity rank number of the attack is reduced by this Power's rank number. The remaining
                    Intensity is the actual damage the hero suffers.

                    While the hero's skin shows the effects of the tremendous abuse it suffers, at least it heals
                    quickly. The Power enables the epidermis to heal at a tenfold rate.

                    The hero can rapidly recover from any wound. Cuts quickly close and disease symptoms disappear. The
                    hero heals at an accelerated rate equal to the Power rank number times the normal amount of time.
                    For example, a Typical rank can heal six times as fast as normal, an Unearthly rank heals at a
                    hundredfold rate, and so on. With time, the hero can regrow large areas of lost tissue, especially
                    severed limbs. Lost limbs or organs require a red FEAT. It cannot repair losses that resulted in the
                    hero's death unless the hero is revived. If such a fatal loss and subsequent revival occurs, the
                    hero requires life-support equipment to give his Power time to function.

                    The hero can survive indefinitely without consuming air, water, or food. Bodily wastes are
                    internally recycled back into useable materials.

                    Normally the hero would not need to replenish himself when his power reached its limit. He merely
                    resumes normal consumption habits (breathe normally, eat a light snack, etc.). This is the permanent
                    form of the power. The temporary form requires the hero to consume mass quantities at the expir-
                    ation of the Power. ("That's the fifteenth steak you've eaten, Fred. How long did you say it's been
                    since you ate last?") The required intake is one-quarter what the hero would normally have consumed
                    during the time he was abstaining. The hero can raise his Power rank +1CS by opting for the
                    temporary form.

                    The hero can channel all his raw energy into a single burst of a chosen Ability or Power. All his
                    Power and Ability rank numbers are totaled together. This rank number replaces the rank number for a
                    chosen Power. Upon the completion of releasing the Power, all the hero's Abilities and Powers
                    temporarily drop to Feeble. This Power's rank number is the total amount of lost points the hero can
                    regain each turn. Points are divided evenly between all the depleted Abilities and Powers. (Okay,
                    this isn't really a Power either. Roll again for an additional Power.)

                    The hero has two different forms. One is a normal, powerless being; the other is the powerful,
                    heroic self. When creating the hero, the player has to create two different beings. The statistics
                    for the primary self should be fairly routine (all physical abilities ranging from Feeble to Good).
                    All bets are off for the heroic self. Something many people never consider is that the heroic self
                    might be a relatively normal human, while the normal self is something a little lower on the
                    evolutionary ladder. For example, you might try a character whose normal self is a mutant dog (why
                    should humans have all the deviant fun?).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The two selves never co-exist except under extraordinary circumstances. Possible causes of
                    simultaneous existence include time warps, cloning, and Lifeform Creation. The two selves may even
                    be separated for an extended time, such as what happened to Bruce Banner and the Hulk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The primary drawback to this Power is the uncontrolled reversion to the normal self, especially when
                    it occurs during dire circumstances. For example, Mightiman is rescuing a sub from the ocean floor
                    when he reverts to his other self, little Eddy Edwards. ("Can you say 'fish food?' Sure you can.")
                </p>
                <p>
                    Variations include automatic or voluntary transformation, duration, and shared minds versus
                    semi-independent mentalities.

                    The hero can transform his body into a coherent energy field that supports his lifeforce and is
                    capable of controlled actions. The energy can be of any type (see the Energy Emission listings).
                </p>
                <p>
                    When creating the character, the player determines the nature of the energy into which the hero can
                    turn. The rank determines the number of possible energy types. The rank for each energy type is
                    originally Good; this is modified by the Ability Modifier Table found on page 6 of the Player's
                    Book. Each Power is rolled separately. Thus, a hero might have a Poor sound-form and an Incredible
                    radiation-form. Damage to the Energy Body is the same as damage to the normal body. The Energy Body
                    is subject to anything that would affect energy of its type. The hero makes a standard Resistance
                    roll to determine such effects on the Energy Body. The hero may find himself confined in a storage
                    field while in energy-form. If so, he must make a red FEAT to attempt to revert to normal. If he
                    fails, he must escape in his energy form.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Energy Body is a relatively unlimited supply of that particular energy type. The hero can expend
                    great amounts of it and still be able to return to normal. Completely depleting the Energy Body
                    requires a red FEAT rolled by the Judge or an adversary. The hero can also ab s orb existing energy
                    of his chosen type to replenish himself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This Power includes the relevant form of Energy Control and Emission for the purpose of controlling
                    the energy within the body.

                    The hero can surround himself with an energy field. This field provides protection, life support,
                    and a means of manifesting the hero's other Powers. The energy field can be of any type (see the
                    Energy Emis sion section for available types). Each energy field has its own characteristics that
                    affect the ways the hero can use the Power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only one Energy Sheath can be used at a time. The hero may possess several possible Energy Sheathes.
                    The original rank for each is Good; this can be modified by the Ability Modifier Table on page 6 in
                    the Player's Book. Each Power is rolled separately. Thus a hero might possess a Poor Sonic Sheath
                    and an Incredible Vibration Sheath.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Damage to the Sheath does not affect the hero's Health. If the Sheath is destroyed, the hero. must
                    make a red FEAT to regain it. Possible ways of destroying a Sheath include Energy Control and
                    Conversion, Power Control, and Magic. When the hero is using this Power, he has a special
                    vulnerability to Energy Control and Conversion Powers that can affect his type of Energy Sheath
                    (-2CS). However, he also has +2CS Resistance to attacks using the same energy form as his Sheath.
                    For the duration of the Sheath, it is assumed to be made of an infinite supply of that energy.
                    (Otherwise, the character bookkeeping would be a nightmare. "Let's see, if I throw a fireball,
                    that's gonna cost five minutes of power...")
                </p>
                <p>
                    When creating the hero, the player can opt to replace one of the other Powers with a Transportation
                    Power. The player can also replace other Powers with the appropriate Energy Emission and Control
                    Powers, if he so chooses.

                    The hero can manipulate energy currents to support and propel his body, thus attaining a form of
                    Flight. The energy can be any type found in the hero's environment, such as magnetism, sound, light,
                    heat, and electricity. The hero can use only one form; the player has to decide which one when he
                    creates the hero.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Carrier Wave can support the hero and an additional load equal to its Power rank in terms of
                    Strength. For example, Magneto's Remarkable rank enables him to tow up to a ton of material. The
                    carrier wave is temporarily solid and visible. Flight occurs at Power rank speed.
                </p>

                    carrier wave is limited to Shift-X speed. It is limited to areas where that energy exists. As the
                    limits of that energy's domain are reached, it becomes weaker and finally fizzles out. The hero
                    continues to move in a ballistic arc before he finally crashes.

                    Carrier waves can be affected by the appropriate Energy Emission and Control Powers. Emission can
                    change the speed or direction of the hero's travel. The Intensity of an opposing Energy Power
                    decreases this Power's rank. A supporting Energy Power adds its Intensity to the Power rank.

                    Example: Lodestone possesses Incredible Magnetic Manipulation. He tries to stop Magneto from flying
                    away. Lodestone's Incredible rank decreases Magneto's Remarkable rank to -10. Magneto comes to an
                    inaudibly screeching halt and begins to fly in reverse at Good speed.

                    The Optional Power is Energy Detection and an Energy Control Power of the same type as the Carrier
                    Wave.

                    The Nemesis is the appropriate Energy Control.
