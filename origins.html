            Your character's physical form is what he looks like now. Oh, he might have been born a relatively normal
            child in Cleveland, Ohio, but this category is how people see him now.

                and have close-knit families; this is a defense mechanism born from generations spent hiding their true
                selves from normal society. Examples of Breed Mutants include the Inhumans.

                Normal Humans. One example is the Vision. Androids generally resemble the race that created them; alien
                androids can be any shape.

                dimension, or lost land hidden somewhere on the Earth. Most can pass as Normal Humans with a little
                disguise or explanation. Some of the Humanoid Race's Powers don't exist in their home environment but
                develop as a result of the Humanoid's exposure to Earth's environment.

            <dd>The hero was created in an operating room. His body contains parts taken from several bodies. Close
                examination reveals the scars from his creation. The most famous example is Adam, the Frankenstein
                Monster. Because of the widespread knowledge of that story, Surgical Composites are feared more than
                Mutants. They also possess a morbid curiosity about the people whose parts now form their bodies.

            <dt id="modified_human">Modified Human</dt>
            <dd>This is someone who started life as a Normal Human and was later altered by some means. The change
                affected his body on a physical level but did not alter his DNA. Genetically, the hero is still very
                much human and cannot pass on his Powers to his descendants. Organic Modification means the hero's
                internal organs and nervous system have been altered. Perhaps he now possesses new organs or glands that
                are the basis for what Powers he has. Muscular Modification is easy to detect; just look for a person
                with outrageous muscular development. Captain America is a good example of this. Skeletal Modification
                means the hero's original skeletal structure has been
                replaced or augmented by artificial means. Although he is also a Random Mutant, Wolverine is a good
                example of this type of character. The new skeleton can be crammed with various things that can give the
                hero his Powers.

            <dd>This type of body is harder to disguise than the other Modifications because the body now possesses
                extra pieces of anatomy. These may be duplicates of normal parts (arms are probably the most common
                example), or parts that are not found on a Normal Human. Such new parts include wings, tails, antennae,
                fins, or anything else that might create Powers for the hero.
                <ul>
                    <li>Humans with Extra Parts roll on column 1.</li>

            <dd>This covers a range of human-like beings who combine the physical traits of humans and animals.
                Demihumans can be unique individuals or members of a race that inhabits a different place or time.
                Because of the wealth of legends surrounding demi-humans, a new character of this type finds that his
                Popularity is influenced by people's preconceived notions and biases toward things with his shape.
                <ul>
                    <li id="centaurs">
                        Centaurs have a human head, torso, and arms mated to the body of a horse. They possess increased
                        Strength (+1CS), can move quickly over horizontal ground (four areas/turn), and can fight with
                        their hooves. On the minus side, centaurs have Feeble Climbing ability. They are popularly
                        thought of as scholars or drunken lechers. Centaurs roll on Column 5.
                    </li>
                    <li id="equimen">
                        Equimen possess horse legs in place of human ones. They have a horse's mane and tail as well.
                        Such beings are often confused with fauns, although equimen lack horns. An equiman is born from
                        two equimen, or from a centaur mating with a human. By hiding the legs and tail, an equiman can
                        pass for human. Kicking does +1CS damage. Equimen roll on Column 3.
                    </li>
                    <li id="fauns">
                        Fauns possess the hairy legs, short tail, and horns of a goat. They are frequently confused with
                        either equimen, who are taller, or with the traditional image of a devil. Because of the
                        unfortunate resemblance to the latter, fauns have an initial Popularity of zero. They possess
                        Feeble Mental Domination over females of any human(oid) race, which, coupled with their penchant
                        for intoxication, causes them to gain Popularity more slowly than other Demihumans. Fauns roll
                        on Column 2.

                    <li id="felinoids">
                        Felinoids are human-shaped, cat-like beings. The overall body shape is human, but the skin is
                        covered in fur and the face is that of a cat. A felinoid has a tail, claws, fangs, pointed ears
                        on top of the head, and slitted pupils in the eyes. A felinoid can see in the dark with
                        Excellent night vision. Such beings possess +1CS Climbing ability. Tigra is a good example.
                        Felinoids roll on Column 1.
                    </li>
                    <li id="lupinoids">
                        Lupinoids are human-shaped, canine-like beings. They are often mistaken for the cinematic
                        conception of a werewolf. The body is covered in hair and the face is definitely canine. The
                        body has a tail, harmless claws, big teeth, and long pointed ears atop the head. A lupinoid
                        possesses an Excellent sense of smell. The Popularity of lupinoids varies. Because some people
                        think every lupinoid is a werewolf, their Popularity decreases -1CS. Other people see them as
                        dogs, and thus as man's best friend; this prevents the Popularity from dropping any further.
                        Lupinoid genetics are the most flexible of all the demihumans. There are as many breeds of
                        lupinoids as there are of dogs, wolves, and foxes (the latter being a subclass, the vulpinoid).
                        Lupinoids roll on Column 4.

                        Avians come in two basic types, angels and harpies. The angelic avians resemble humans with
                        wings sprouting from the shoulder blades. Angel of X-Factor is this type. They get an increased
                        Popularity (+1CS). Harpies possess arms that are modified to also serve as wings and
                        feathercovered legs that end in bird claws. They gain +1CS Fighting. Angelic avians reproduce by
                        normal human means. Harpies lay eggs. Angelic Avians roll on Column 3. Harpies roll on Column 2.

                        Chiropterans are similar to angelic humans except that they combine the human parts with those
                        of a bat. Their arms also serve as leathery wings, their feet have elongated toes that can serve
                        as hands, and in addition they possess large ears. They possess the Power of Active Sonar at
                        Good rank. 'Pterans scare most people, especially the bulk of the populace who believe all bats
                        are Vampires. Initial Popularity is Feeble. Chiropterans roll on Column 2.

                    <li id="lamians">
                        Lamians are snake people. The legs have been replaced by a serpentine body, although the arms
                        are normal. The skin is covered in fine scales. Lamians have lidless eyes and retractable fangs.
                        There is a 50% chance the lamian is venomous (Excellent Intensity poison). Because snakes
                        terrify so many people, the lamian's initial Popularity is zero. Lamians are difficult to bind
                        (+1CS to escape). Lamians roll on Column 3.

                        a limited time because their bodies quickly dry out. Movement on dry land is limited to crawling
                        or dependence on vehicles. Merhumans also possess Water Freedom. They fascinate Normal Humans
                        and have an increased Popularity (+1CS). The usefulness of a merhuman in a land-locked campaign
                        is limited, but certain Powers can overcome the merhuman's disadvantages— Shapechange, Alter
                        Ego, True Flight, and so on. Merhumans roll on Column 2.

                        The hero began as a Normal Human but has had parts of his body replaced by artificial devices.
                        This may have been done to save the hero's life after a near-fatal accident or the hero may have
                        voluntarily undergone the operation in order to gain Powers. The original Deathlok is an example
                        of the former type. Cyborgs initially have a decreased Intuition (-1CS) due to mental anguish
                        over a perceived loss of humanity (in the former case) or a self-hatred toward their original
                        weak human form (in the latter).
                        While most cyborgs are High Tech creations, there are also Magical Cyborgs. For example, the
                        Celtic god Nuada had an arm made of silver.
                        The player should determine what parts are artificial, using the randomly generated Abilities
                        and Powers as a guide. For example, Strength of Remarkable or better suggests the limbs and
                        skeleton are artificial. Speed-running could come from a leg-replacement. Vision Powers seem to
                        require at least one man-made eye. At least one Contact must be either the lab or hospital that
                        created him of a facility that provides maintenance services.

                        The hero's body is intact but is encased in a mechanical suit that provides him with
                        life-support and Powers. The natural and artificial bodies exist in symbiosis. Tony Stark/iron
                        Man is the perfect example of this.
                        The most common Exoskeletons are roughly the same size and shape as the being within; that is,
                        the Exoskeleton resembles a clunky suit of armor. Exoskeletons can come in any size of shape,
                        however. The giant robots of Japanese cartoons are actually immense Cyborg Exoskeletons.

                            The only part of the hero's original body that remains is his brain and the nervous system.
                            This is housed in a special life-support module that fills most of the brain's needs
                            (oxygen, blood, nutrients). The lifesupport module is mated with a mechanical form that
                            serves the brain as its new body. The nervous system is directly linked with the machine's
                            control circuits, allowing both control and sensory feedback.

                            Mech bodied characters are often mistaken for Pure Robots. In fact, an internal examination
                            is needed to clearly distinguish the two types. Of course, Pure Robots don't feel the urge
                            to cry. Mech bodies are even more morose than Mech Limb cyborgs; at least the latter retain
                            some of their bodies. Their depression causes them to have a lower initial Intuition and
                            Psyche (-1CS to both). Mech Bodies have Monstrous Resistance to Disease and Poisons of all
                            sorts. This is because the brain is doubly protected from the outside world. However, they
                            are prone to things that never harm a flesh-bound character, like Magnetic attacks and rust.

                            When creating the hero, the player must decide what his Mech Body looks like. For most
                            campaigns, the Mech Body is basically humanshaped. It may even have a pseudo-flesh covering
                            to disguise the body's true nature. Such coverings tend not to survive battles, though, so
                            the hero must have a spare supply. Replacing a full body cover has an Excellent cost; a
                            head-and-hands-only set is a bargain of Good cost.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Mech Bodies can come in other shapes. These can be anything the hero might find useful in
                            his environment: spider-bots, baby tanks, starships, etc. Since specialized Mech Bodies are
                            less adaptable, such characters tend to be NPCs. Mech Bodies are not limited to a single
                            body, though. A lab with Remarkable facilities can adapt the life-support module for easy
                            transferral to other bodies. Thus, your hero can have as many bodies as his Resources can
                            provide.

                            The hero is a computer, period. At first glance this seems unplayable, but bear me out. This
                            is a rare computer, one that is self-aware and possesses true intelligence. While the
                            mainframe itself is immobile and unable to physically act, peripherals give the sentient
                            computer a wide range of means to deal with the physical world. Robots act as proxies
                            for the computer. Physical additions provide tile mainframe with add-on functions. The
                            Computer can directly interact with other computers, robots, and some cyborgs on a
                            programming level.

                            programs are "living" beings. If the computer possesses Alter Ego or Lifeform Creation, it
                            can create a human-like extension of itself. Such a being would possess all the computer's
                            abilities and most of its Powers (save those assigned to the peripheral hardware). Damage to
                            the extension results in feedback that causes equivalent damage to the mainframe.

                    These are magical beings from other planes of existence. They are both supernatural and corporeal in
                    nature. The main difference between these types is their inherent personality. "Angels" are
                    benevolent; "demons" are malevolent. Other than that, there isn't much difference.

                    These beings resemble characters from various mythologies. This affects their Popularity. Angels
                    gain +2CS while demons lose -2CS on their initial Popularity. These beings do not necessarily
                    follow the popular traditional behavior patterns. A heroic demon might be fighting a personal
                    war against other, even more evil beings. A crazed angel might be a villain, seeking to purify
                    the Earth at any cost.

                    This is an "Entity of Great Power" — or rather, was such a being. The deity was an actual god,
                    demigod, or close relative who was actually worshipped at some point in the past. Now his powers
                    have waned because the religion which was devoted to him is no longer practiced. His followers have
                    disappeared into the annals of history. Thor is an example of such a being.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now he is a god-on-Earth and locked into a mortal shell. He is still a formidable being, though.
                    Deities have increased ranks in all their primary abilities and cannot really die in the Earth
                    Dimension unless the slayer is another deity. Each deity has a home dimension; on that plane the
                    deity loses his special protection from death.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Deities are usable as player characters. The Marvel Universe includes Asgardians, Olympians, and
                    deities from a host of other pantheons. Both Thor and Hercules are members of the Avengers.
                    Snowbird, daughter of an Inuit goddess, is a member of Alpha Flight. The thing that permits their
                    playability is their diminished Power. Once Odin formed the Earth from the blood and bones of a
                    slain Ice Giant, but he can't do things like that anymore.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are three reasons a deity might be found on Earth. One is that his Powers have diminished to
                    such a point that the Earth Dimension is the only place he can survive. The second is that he has
                    been sent to the Earth Dimension by other, more powerful Deities. Both Thor and Snowbird are in this
                    category. The third reason is that the deity is bored with timeless infinity and is slumming it on
                    Earth as a way of generating excitement. Hercules fits this bill.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Actually, there is also a fourth reason. The deity might be on Earth seeking Power, whether by
                    regaining worshippers or establishing a portal between Earth and his home dimension. However, for
                    game purposes, this reason is restricted to NPC deities who are acting as villains in your campaign.

                        Deities have increased Popularity (+2CS) with the public but zero Popularity with the hierarchy

                    <li>
                        Deities eventually attract any remaining living worshippers they still have. All of these people
                        serve as Contacts. A deity PC who abuses his worshippers faces a stiff Karma penalty.

                    <li>
                        Deities are honor-bound not to actively promote a religion based on themselves. Deity PCs who
                        try this lose -1CS from all their Abilities and Powers.

                    This is a catch-all category that includes fish, mammals, birds, reptiles, and the rest of Earth's
                    fauna, in addition to aliens that do not fit into any other category. About the only example of this
                    in the Marvel Universe is Lockheed, the dragon. Your campaign, on the other hand, might be filled
                    with heroic Animals or really peculiar aliens (I'll fudge a little and include Lockjaw, the
                    Inhumans' "dog" as an example of this).

                    Animal PCs have three main types of backgrounds. One is that the animal is a mutant. Another is that
                    the animal was altered in ways that gave his intelligence and Power. The last is the animal is a
                    relatively normal member of a race of animals like him (Lockheed, for example). The player can
                    determine this in the Origins of Power section and embellish it to the best of his ability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Animals have to have a human Contact. People tend to see the human Contact as the animal's owner or
                    trainer. People refuse initially to believe the animal is intelligent. Animals have very few legal
                    rights, but they also have few responsibilities.

                        Resources are zero unless the animal has attached himself to a human. In this case, the Resource

                    The hero is an intelligent, mobile plant. He can be of any nature but for game purposes the hero is
                    assumed to be a man-shaped plant. His physiology is based on photosynthesis. The plant-man doesn't
                    need to eat anything except a bit of fertilizer occasionally. Prolonged deprivation of light and
                    water reduces the hero's Strength and Endurance -1CS per day after an initial three days.

                    key element in the body's chemical makeup is replaced by another element. The most common

                    In all these cases, acquiring food that fits the hero's metabolic needs is a problem. If the

                    the necessary foodstuffs. For game purposes, assume the hero already possesses a steady food supply.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because of the different body chemistries, abnormals cannot donate blood or body tissues for
                    transfusion into Normal Humans. Likewise, anything foolish enough to try to feed on the abnormal,
                    like a lion or a Bio-Vampire, takes Good damage as it tries to digest what, to its system, is
                    poison.

                    The body is composed of solid materials that normally do not sustain life. In fact, the body might
                    not even have anything remotely resembling internal organs. In such cases, an internal examination
                    would only reveal homogenous matter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The body can be of any single element or compound or a mixture of anything the player can think of.
                    Examples of Mineral Life include golems and Warlock (of the New Mutants).

                <p>
                    Because Mineral Life is simpler, it is easier to feed and maintain. If food is needed, the Mineral
                    Life can digest raw matter of its composition. Wounds can be bandaged by applications of the same
                    matter as well. ("But Doctor, I'm not a bricklayer!")

                    Life is vulnerable to attacks with special effects on the body materials. For example, an iron golem
                    is prone to rust.

                    You know that the Normal Human body is 68% liquid? Well, this type is 100% liquid. However, it is
                    composed of special liquids that remain together. The fluid body can be of any viscosity from
                    gelatinous to watery. It can move at will by flowing through other liquids or along surfaces. It can
                    even climb vertical surfaces.

                <p>
                    If the liquid life possesses Endurance and Psyche ranks of Excellent or better, the Fluid Body can

                <p>
                    Contrary to what you might think, a Fluid Body is actually dry to the touch. This is because none of
                    the body's liquids leave the body unless deliberately secreted.

                <p>
                    The Fluid Body can be housed in a naturally secreted sac or in an artificial container. This is

                    If the Fluid Body is frozen, the hero is immobilized until he can melt. He takes no damage from such
                    an attack, although sacs or body containers might be shattered by the cold. Vaporization is a fatal
                    act for most Fluid Bodies.

                    <li>
                        Because of the Fluid Bodies' control over their own fluids, it requires an Incredible Agility

                    The hero is an intangible, disembodied spirit. He can be a ghost who once possesses a mortal shell,
                    or belong to a race that always exists in this form. An Ethereal can drift about in any direction he
                    chooses, and can pass through solid matter without any effort. The visibility of an Ethereal varies
                    according to his whim; he can be invisible, transparent, translucent, or opaque.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the Ethereal is a ghost, his form resembles an idealized version of his old body. The ghost's
                    appearance is actually based on his self-image and thus reflects the ghost's attitude toward
                    himself. This is why ghosts are usually either very beautiful (or handsome) or quite pathetic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ghosts are immune to most physical attacks with Intensities less than Unearthly. They are vulnerable
                    to Mental and Magical attacks, especially by Powers that affect the spirit. Either Psi or Spirit
                    Vampirism can destroy an Ethereal.

                <p>
                    While Ethereals are intangible on the Earth Dimension, they regain solidity in other Dimensions. In
                    such realms Ethereals are vulnerable to all Powers except those that specifically affect Ethereals
                    and other disembodied beings; these Powers are Spirit Summoning and Storage, Reincarnation, and
                    Exorcism.

                <p>
                    If the Ethereal once had a solid body, he might not necessarily have died to reach his current
                    state. He might have become an Ethereal by being directly transformed from solidity to ethereality.
                    Such transformations can be magical, scientific, Power-based, accidental, or deliberate. The Red
                    Ghost is an example of a Normal Human directly transformed into an Ethereal as a result of a
                    scientific mishap.

                    same). Special means are required to maintain the reunion of mind and body. This can be anything
                    from being frequently re-embalmed to utilizing any of the Vampiric Powers. If the Undead fails to
                    follow his required maintenance procedures, he begins to fall apart. In Undead terms, this is what
                    Health points are used for. Health is the structural integrity of the Undead's own corpse.

                    hybrid forms that still retain some humanity. Dracula's daughter Lilith is such a being, being

            More importantly, how did he get the Powers that set him apart from mortal men (or cyborgs or centaurs or
            kitty cats)? This is the stage where you determine the Origin of Power. There are 11 possibilities here,
            each one a single event in your character's life that transformed him/her/it into a Super Hero.
        </p>
        <p>
            The player can interpret the Origin two ways. The first way assumes that the character has always had
            approximately the same Physical Form that he now possesses. In that case, the Origin is the event in which
            his Powers first appeared. The second way of interpreting the Origin is to assume that the character began
            life as a perfectly Normal, Human, say a kid from Euclid, Ohio. In that case, the Origin was an event that
            not only gave him Power, it may have also drastically altered his Physical form.

                Werewolves and Bio-Vampires are common examples of this. Normal Humans are transformed into those kinds

            <dt id="chemical_exposure">Chemical Exposure</dt>
            <dd>The hero was transformed by exposure to an exotic element, compound, or mixture. This substance can be
                inhaled, ingested, injected, or just placed next to the hero for it to affect him. The chemicals
                involved in these incidents react in random ways with the hero's genetic structure and produce unique
                results. If another person is exposed to the same chemical, the results may be different or fatal.
                Madcap is an example of this.</dd>
            <dt>Energy Exposure</dt>
            <dd>The hero was exposed to a special form and Intensity of energy– anything out of the ordinary will do and
                turned into his present self. Most of the Marvel Super Heroes from the early 1960s are examples of this.
                The Fantastic Four, the Hulk, and Daredevil, for examples, all received Powers after being subjected to
                hard radiation.</dd>
            <dt>Rebirth</dt>
            <dd>The hero was once a perfectly ordinary person. Then he died. Something happened to him that destroyed
                his old body and gave him a new one, complete with Power. Examples of this class include Marc
                Spector/Moon Knight and Arthur Douglas/Drax the Destroyer.</dd>

        <h2 id="weaknesses">Weaknesses</h2>
        <p>
            Everybody has an Achilles' Heel, a weak ness that can really mess up his day. The nature and severity of the
            weakness varies with the individual, race, or class. Normal Humans have so many we don't even think about
            them, aside from heeding such warnings as "Poison" or skull-and-crossbones symbols.
        </p>
        <p>
            A Weakness is a cause-and-effect situation. A specific stimulus causes the Weakness to appear. Its effect is
            what actually occurs to the hero as a result of being exposed to the stimulus.
        </p>
        <p>
            The final consideration is the duration of the Weakness. This is the length of time the hero is affected.
        </p>
        <p>
            Okay, why should you, the player, even pay attention to this section? As I said, everyone has a weakness.
            For Normal Humans, the standard stimuli are Elemental Allergy, Molecular Allergy, and Energy Allergy with
            Fatal Effects. Superpowered heroes possess an enhanced resistance to all of these stimuli but retain a
            special Weakness to a specific stimulus. Normally, the effect is limited to Negation and Incapacitation, but
            if the hero possesses any Power with a rank exceeding Remarkable, there is a possibility that a Fatal
            Weakness exists.
        </p>
        <h3 id="stimuli">Stimuli</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt id="psychological_weakness">Psychological Weakness</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    A specific event, condition, or mental state has an adverse effect on the hero. This Stimulus
                    directly affects the hero's mind; any resulting physical damage is psychosomatic in nature. That
                    is, any physical damage results are due to the hero's instinctive belief in those results.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Examples include being physically bound, even if the hero could normally snap the binding material;
                    facing a foe covered in a specific color; or feeling extremely confused.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Psychological Weaknesses can be temporarily overcome by an Unearthly Intensity Psyche FEAT. They can
                    be permanently overcome by a Shift-Z Intensity Psyche FEAT.
                </p>
            </dd>
            <dt id="elemental_allergy">Elemental Allergy</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    The hero suffers adverse effects if he is exposed to a specific one of the hundred-odd elements.
                    This Allergy only occurs if the element is present in a pure state and in an accumulation of at
                    least one ounce. If the element is combined in a molecular state or is in insufficient quantities,
                    no Effect occurs. The element must be within 20 feet of the hero for it to have any Effect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This allergy can be overcome by physically insulating the hero from the element or by increasing the
                    distance between them.
                </p>
            </dd>
            <dt id="molecular_allergy">Molecular Allergy</dt>
            <dd>This is similar to Elemental Allergy. A specific compound causes the Effect. Common examples include
                water, wood, and Adamantium.</dd>
            <dt id="energy_allergy">Energy Allergy</dt>
            <dd>The hero suffers when he is exposed to a specific form of energy. This can be any wavelength or
                Intensity of energy found in the Energy Emission and Energy Control sections of this book. Sunlight is a
                common example of Energy Allergy, particularly when dealing with supernatural beings.</dd>
            <dt id="energy_depletion">Energy Depletion</dt>
            <dd>The hero has a finite energy supply that permits him to manifest Power. This energy must be periodically
                renewed by means of rest, food, Energy Absorption, Energy Vampirism, or simply making contact with a
                source of that energy. If the hero's energy level drops too low, dire Effects result.</dd>
            <dt id="energy_dampening">Energy Dampening</dt>
            <dd>The hero has the problem of having to release the energy pent up within himself; this is done by using
                his Powers. If the hero is somehow prevented from using his Powers, the energy begins to do internal
                damage.</dd>
            <dt id="finite_limit">Finite Limit</dt>
            <dd>All of the hero's Powers have a finite number of times they can be used. This is determined by a second,
                independent Power rank roll; this rank number is the number of uses remaining for that Power. When a
                Power is depleted, the hero suffers the Effect. The Judge can determine how such Powers can be
                recharged.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h3 id="effects">Effects</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt id="power_negation">Power Negation</dt>
            <dd>The hero's Powers cease to function when the hero is within 20 feet of the stimulus. The hero's Primary
                Abilities are also affected; these drop -1CS per 10 turns until a minimum rank of Typical is reached for
                all of them. If the. hero is beyond the 20 foot limit but tries to use his Powers to affect the
                Stimulus, certain uses of Power automatically fail. Any Power that directly acts on a target cannot
                affect a Stimulus. Only Powers that indirectly affect the Stimulus succeed, such as using brute force to
                lob missiles at the Stimulus.</dd>
            <dt id="incapacitation">Incapacitation</dt>
            <dd>The hero becomes physically ill after exposure to the Stimulus. Beginning with the initial contact, the
                hero loses one point of Health per turn. This loss continues for the Duration of the Effect. However,
                the loss stops when Health reaches zero; this Effect does not directly kill the hero. The hero retains
                his Powers but finds it harder to use them as his condition worsens.</dd>
            <dt id="fatal">Fatal</dt>
            <dd>As in the above, the hero gets ill after the initial exposure to the Stimulus. However, the Health loss
                does not stop at zero. Death will eventually occur if Health and (subsequently) Endurance drop to zero
                during the Weakness Duration. The hero can be revived if proper medical attention is given, but only
                after his Health and Endurance have both reached zero.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h3 id="duration">Duration</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt id="continuous_with_contact">Continuous with Contact</dt>
            <dd>As long as the hero remains within the effective range of the Stimulus, the Effect continues. When the
                hero is insulated or moved away from the Stimulus, the Effect
                immediately ceases. Lost Health points are returned at a rate of 2 per turn. If death has occurred, the
                hero
                now has the possibility of being revived.
            <dt id="limited_duration_with_contact">Limited Duration with Contact</dt>
            <dd>The Effect begins immediately upon contact with the Stimulus. However, the Effect only functions for a
                limited amount of time. After that time elapses, the hero is assumed to have either built up a temporary
                immunity to the Stimulus or the Stimulus has discharged its Effect. In either case, the Stimulus cannot
                further affect the hero. Duration is 1 -100 turns after initial Contact. The Judge makes a random die
                roll to determine this.</dd>
            <dt id="limited_duration_after_contact">Limited Duration After Contact</dt>
            <dd>The Effect is continuous with Contact and also lasts for a limited time after the hero is no longer
                exposed to the Stimulus. Duration is 1 -100 turns after the hero's contact, with the Stimulus is broken.
                The Judge may either randomly determine this or develop his own criteria.</dd>
            <dt id="permanent">Permanent</dt>
            <dd>The Stimulus does its full damage to the hero, even when exposure to the Stimulus has been interrupted.
                In this case, the Stimulus sets off a bodily self-destruction sequence that must continue to its full
                extent. In the case of Power Negation, the hero's Powers are permanently lost. Incapacitation results in
                the hero reaching zero Health points and lapsing into a coma lasting 1 -10 days. After that time, he may
                regain his Health at the normal rate. Fatal results in the death of the hero as both Health and
                Endurance drop to zero. The hero can be revived, however, and will eventually recover if revival occurs.
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
            Heroes and villains should do their utmost to prevent anyone except their most trusted companions from
            learning the nature of their Weakness. Barring that, the hero should try to find ways to avoid the Stimulus
            or circumvent the Effect.
        </p>
        <p>
            Players and Judges should work together to develop a playable Weakness. The more Powerful the character, the
            more common the
        </p>
        <p>
            Stimulus should be. For example, when I was testing the character generation system set out in this book, I
            rolled up a character I named "Godling." Godling was a Normal Human who had been Reborn into an Entity of
            Great Power. He possessed 30 different Powers, but had one tragic flaw. Magnetism completely negated his
            Powers. (He spent all his days and nights trying to escape Earth's gravitational Pull.)
        </p>
        <p>
            The Nemesis Power can be used to simulate Stimuli, but this should be used as a last resort. Judges who do
            this should be penalized by the players. (I suggest withholding munchies for the next month—KM)
